George Gershwin - Summertime


[Verse]
Summertime                        vi--- III7---
And the livin' is easy            vi--- vi-VI7-
Fish are jumpin'                  ii--- ii---
And the cotton is high            III7--- III7---
Your daddy's rich                 vi--- III7---
And your mamma's good lookin'     vi--- ii7-V7-
So hush little baby               I--- vii7b5-III7-
Don't you cry                     vi--- [III7|vi]---

[Verse]
One of these mornings             vi--- III7---
You're going to rise up singing   vi--- vi-VI7-
Then you'll spread your wings     ii--- ii---
And you'll take to the sky        III7--- III7---
But till that morning             vi--- III7---
There's a'nothing can harm you    vi--- ii7-V7-
With daddy and mamma              I--- vii7b5-III7-
Standing by                       vi--- [III7|vi]---
