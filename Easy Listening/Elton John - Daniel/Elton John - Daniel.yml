  - Verse 1: |
      Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
      I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain Oh and
      I can see Daniel waving goodbye
      God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
      ....

  - Verse 2: |
      They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been
      Well Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen Oh and
      he should know, he's been there enough
      Lord I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much

  - Chorus: |
      Oh, Daniel my brother, you are older than me
      Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
      Your eyes have died, but you see more than I
      Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky

      I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain Oh and
      I can see Daniel waving goodbye
      God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
      Oh God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
