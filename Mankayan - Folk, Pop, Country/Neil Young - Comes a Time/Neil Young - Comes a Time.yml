  - Verse: |
      Comes a time when you're driftin'
      Comes a time when you settle down
      Comes a light, feelings liftin'
      Lift that baby right up off the ground

  - Chorus: |
      Oh,
        this old world keeps
        spinnin' 'round
      It's a wonder tall trees ain't
        layin' down
      There comes a time

  - Verse: |
      You and I, we were captured
      We took our souls and we flew away
      We were right, we were giving
      That's how we kept what we gave away

  - Chorus: |
      Oh,
        this old world keeps
        spinnin' 'round
      It's a wonder tall trees ain't
        layin' down
      There comes a time

  - Outro: |
      Oh,
        this old world keeps
        spinnin' 'round
      It's a wonder tall trees ain't
        layin' down
      There comes a time
      There comes a time

      Comes a time, comes a time

      (1) Comes a time
      (2) Comes a time
      (3) Comes a time
      (4) Comes a time
      (5) Comes a time
