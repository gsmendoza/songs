Don Mclean - American Pie


[Verse (First)]
<G> <D> <Em>-                A long, long time ago
<Am>- <C>-                   I can still remember
<Em>- <D>---                 how that music used to make me smile.

<G> <D> <Em>-                And I knew if I had my chance
<Am>- <C>-                   that I could make those people dance
<Em>- <C>- <D>---            and maybe they'd be happy for a while.

<Em>- <Am>-                  But February made me shiver
<Em>- <Am>-                  with every paper I'd deliver.
<C> <G> <Am>-                Bad news on the doorstep.
<C>- <D>-                    I couldn't take one more step.

<G> <D> <Em>-                I can't remember if I cried
<C>- <D>-                    when I read about his widowed bride,
<G> <D> <Em>-                Something touched me deep inside
<C>- <D>- <G>---             the day the music died.

[Chorus]
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          So bye-bye, Miss American Pie.
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry,
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and Rye,
<Em>--- <A7>---              singing this'll be the day that I die,
<Em>--- <D>--- ----          This'll be the day that I die.

[Verse (Fast)]
<G>- <Am>-                   Did you write the book of love
<C>- <Am>-                   and do you have faith in God above?
<Em>- <D>---                 If the Bible tells you so

<G> <D> <Em>-                Now do you believe in rock and roll?
<Am>- <C>-                   Can music save your mortal soul?
<Em>- <A7>- <D>---           and can you teach me how to dance real slow?

<Em>- <D>-                   Well I know that you're in love with him
<Em>- <D>-                   'cause I saw you dancing in the gym,
<C> <G> <A7>-                You both kicked off your shoes,
<C>- <D7>-                   Man I dig those rhythm and blues!

<G> <D> <Em>-                I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck,
<Am>- <C>-                   with a pink carnation and a pick-up truck.
<G> <D> <Em>-                But I knew I was out of luck
<C>- <D>- <G> <C> <G> <D>    the day, the music died. I started singing

[Chorus]
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          So bye-bye, Miss American Pie.
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry,
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and Rye,
<Em>--- <A7>---              singing this'll be the day that I die,
<Em>--- <D>--- ----          This'll be the day that I die.

[Verse (Fast)]
<G>- <Am>-                   Now for ten years, we've been on our own
<C>- <Am>-                   and moss grows fat on a rolling stone,
<Em>- <D>---                 But that's not how it used to be.

<G> <D> <Em>-                Cause when the jester sang for the King & Queen
<Am>- <C>-                   in a coat he borrowed from James Dean
<Em>- <A7>- <D>---           and a voice that came from you and me

<Em>- <D>-                   Oh and while the king was looking down
<Em>- <D>-                   the jester stole his thorny crown
<C> <G> <A7>-                the court room was adjourned
<C>- <D7>-                   no verdict was returned.

<G> <D> <Em>-                And while Lennon read a book on Marx
<Am>- <C>-                   the quartet practiced in the park
<G> <D> <Em>-                and we sang dirges in the dark
<C>- <D>- <G> <C> <G> <D>    the day the music died. I started singin'

[Chorus]
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          So bye-bye, Miss American Pie.
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry,
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and Rye,
<Em>--- <A7>---              singing this'll be the day that I die,
<Em>--- <D>--- ----          This'll be the day that I die.

[Verse (Fast)]
<G>- <Am>-                   Helter skelter in the summer swelter
<C>- <Am>-                   the birds flew off with a fallout shelter
<Em>- <D>---                 Eight miles high and falling fast

<G> <D> <Em>-                It landed foul on the grass
<Am>- <C>-                   he players tried for a forward pass
<Em>- <A7>- <D>---           with the jester on the sidelines in a cast

<Em>- <D>-                   The half time air was sweet perfume
<Em>- <D>-                   while the seargeants played a marching tune
<C> <G> <A7>-                we all got up to dance
<C>- <D7>-                   but we never got the chance.

<G> <D> <Em>-                'Cause the players tried to take the field,
<Am>- <C>-                   but the marching band refused to yield
<G> <D> <Em>-                Do you recall what was revealed
<C>- <D>- <G> <C> <G> <D>    the day the music died. I started singin'

[Chorus]
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          So bye-bye, Miss American Pie.
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry,
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and Rye,
<Em>--- <A7>---              singing this'll be the day that I die,
<Em>--- <D>--- ----          This'll be the day that I die.

[Verse (Fast)]
<G>- <Am>-                   And there we were all in one place,
<C>- <Am>-                   A generation lost in space.
<Em>- <D>---                 With no time left, to start again.

<G> <D> <Em>-                So come on, Jack be nimble, jack be quick,
<Am>- <C>-                   Jack flash sat on a candlestick.
<Em>- <A7>- <D>---           'Cause fire is the devil's only friend.

<Em>- <D>-                   And as I watched him on the stage
<Em>- <D>-                   my hands were clenched in fists of rage.
<C> <G> <A7>-                no angel born in hell
<C>- <D7>-                   could break that satan's spell

<G> <D> <Em>-                And as the flames climbed high into the night
<Am>- <C>-                   to light the sacrificial rite
<G> <D> <Em>-                I saw Satan laughing with delight,
<C>- <D>- <G> <C> <G> <D>    the day the music died. We were singin'

[Chorus]
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          So bye-bye, Miss American Pie.
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry,
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and Rye,
<Em>--- <A7>---              singing this'll be the day that I die,
<Em>--- <D>--- ----          This'll be the day that I die.

[Verse (Last)]
<G> <D> <Em>-                I met a girl who sang the blues
<Am>- <C>-                   so I asked her for some happy news
<Em>- <D>---                 but she just smiled and turned away.

<G> <D> <Em>-                I went down to the sacred store.
<Am>- <C>-                   Where I heard the music years before.
<Em>- <C>- <D>---            But the man there said the music wouldn't play.

<Em>- <D>-                   And in the streets the children screamed,
<Em>- <D>-                   the lovers cried and the poets dreamed.
<C> <G> <Am>-                But not a word was spoken.
<C>- <D>-                    The church bells all were broken.

<G> <D> <Em>-                And the three men I admire most:
<C>- <D>-                    the father, Son and the Holy Ghost
<G> <D> <Em>-                They caught the last train for the coast
<C>- <D>- <G>---             the day, the music died. And they were singing

[Chorus]
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          So bye-bye, Miss American Pie.
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry,
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and Rye,
<Em>--- <A7>---              singing this'll be the day that I die,
<Em>--- <D>--- ----          This'll be the day that I die.

[Chorus (Last)]
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          So bye-bye, Miss American Pie.
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry,
<G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-          them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and Rye,
<C>- <D>- <G> <C> <G>---     singing this'll be the day that I die.
