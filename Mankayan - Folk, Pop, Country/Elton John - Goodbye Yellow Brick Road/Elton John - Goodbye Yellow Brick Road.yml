  - Intro: |
      . . . .

  - Verse: |
      When are you gonna come down?
      When are you going to land?
      I should have stayed on the farm.
      Should have listened to my old man.

      You know you can't hold me forever.
      I didn't sign up with you.
      I'm not a present for your friends to open.
      This boy's too young to be singing the

      blues...
      Ah...
      Ah...

  - Chorus: |
      So goodbye yellow brick road
      Where the dogs of society howl.
      You can't plant me in your penthouse.
      I'm going back to my plough.

      Back to the howling old owl in the woods
      Hunting the horny back toad.
      Oh I've finally decided my future lies
      Beyond the yellow brick

      road...
      Ah...
      Ah...
      ....

  - Verse: |
      What do you think you'll do then?
      I bet that'll shoot down your plane.
      It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
      To set you on your feet again.

      May be you'll get a replacement.
      There's plenty like me to be found.
      Mongrels who ain't got a penny,
      Sniffing for tid bits like you

      on the ground...
      Ah...
      Ah...

  - Chorus: |
      So goodbye yellow brick road
      Where the dogs of society howl.
      You can't plant me in your penthouse.
      I'm going back to my plough.

      Back to the howling old owl in the woods
      Hunting the horny back toad.
      Oh I've finally decided my future lies
      Beyond the yellow brick

      road...
      Ah...
      Ah...
      ....
