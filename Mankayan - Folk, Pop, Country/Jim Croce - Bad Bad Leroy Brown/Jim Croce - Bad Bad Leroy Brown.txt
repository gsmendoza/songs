[Intro]
<G>--- <G>- <D7>-     ...

[Verse]
<G>---                Well the South side of Chicago
<Am>---               is the baddest part of town
<B7>- <C>-            And if you go down there you better just beware
<D> <C> <G> <D7>      Of a man named Leroy Brown

[Verse]
<G>---                Now Leroy more than trouble
<Am>---               you see he stand about six foot four
<B7>- <C>-            All the downtown ladies call him treetop lover
<D> <C> <G> <D7>      All the men just call him sir

[Chorus]
<G>---                And he bad, bad Leroy Brown
<Am>---               The baddest man in the whole damned town
<B7>- <C>-            Badder than old King Kong
<D> <C> <G> <D7>      And meaner than a junkyard dog

[Verse]
<G>---                Now Leroy, he a gambler
<Am>---               and he like his fancy clothes
<B7>- <C>-            And he like to wave his diamond rings
<D> <C> <G> <D7>      in front of everybody's nose

[Verse]
<G>---                He got a custom Continental,
<Am>---               he got an Eldorado too
<B7>- <C>-            He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun,
<D> <C> <G> <D7>      he got a razor in his shoe

[Chorus]
<G>---                And he bad, bad Leroy Brown
<Am>---               The baddest man in the whole damned town
<B7>- <C>-            Badder than old King Kong
<D> <C> <G> <D7>      And meaner than a junkyard dog

[Verse]
<G>---                Now Friday 'bout a week ago
<Am>---               Leroy shootin' dice
<B7>- <C>-            And at the edge of the bar sat a girl name Doris
<D> <C> <G> <D7>      and oo, that girl looked nice

[Verse]
<G>---                Well he cast his eyes upon her
<Am>---               and the trouble soon began
<B7>- <C>-            Leroy Brown learned a lesson 'bout messin'
<D> <C> <G> <D7>      With the wife of a jealous man

[Chorus]
<G>---                And he bad, bad Leroy Brown
<Am>---               The baddest man in the whole damned town
<B7>- <C>-            Badder than old King Kong
<D> <C> <G> <D7>      And meaner than a junkyard dog

[Verse]
<G>---                Well the two men took to fighting
<Am>---               And when they pulled them from the floor
<B7>- <C>-            Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
<D> <C> <G> <D7>      With a couple of pieces gone.

[Chorus]
<G>---                And he bad, bad Leroy Brown
<Am>---               The baddest man in the whole damned town
<B7>- <C>-            Badder than old King Kong
<D> <C> <G> <D7>      And meaner than a junkyard dog

[Last Chorus]
<G>---                And he bad, bad Leroy Brown
<Am>---               The baddest man in the whole damned town
<B7>- <C>-            Badder than old King Kong
<D> <C> <G>-          And meaner than a junkyard dog
<B7>- <C>-            Yeah, he was badder than old King Kong
<D> <C> <G> <G>...    And meaner than a junkyard dog
