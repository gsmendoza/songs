  - Interlude: |
      ...

  - Verse: |
      There's a light, a certain kind of light
      That never shone on me
      I want my life to be
      Lived with you, lived with you

  - Verse: |
      There's a way, everybody say
      To do each and every little thing
      But what does it bring?
      If I ain't got you, ain't got you?

  - Chorus: |
      You don't know what it's like, baby
      You don't know what it's like
      To love somebody, to love somebody
      The way I love you

  - Interlude

  - Verse: |
      In my brain, I see your face again
      I know my frame of mind
      You ain't got to be so blind
      And I'm blind, so very blind

  - Verse: |
      I'm a man, can't you see what I am?
      I live and breathe for you
      But what good does it do
      If I ain't got you, ain't got?
