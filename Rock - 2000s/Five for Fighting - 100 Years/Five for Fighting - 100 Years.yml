  - Verse: |
      I'm fifteen for a moment
      Caught in between ten and twenty

      And I'm just dreamin'
      Countin' the ways to where you are

  - Verse: |
      I'm twenty-two for a moment
      And she feels better than ever

      And we're on fire
      Makin' our way back from Mars

  - Chorus: |
      Fifteen, there's still time for you
      Time to buy and time to lose

      Fifteen, there's never
      a wish better than this
      When you only got a hundred years to live

  - Interlude: |
      . . . .
      . . . .

  - Verse: |
      I'm thirty-three for a moment
      I'm still the man, but you see, I'm a they

      A kid on the way, babe
      A family on my mind

  - Verse: |
      I'm forty-five for a moment
      The sea is high and I'm headin'

      Into a crisis
      Chasin' the years of my life

  - Chorus 2: |
      Fifteen, there's still time for you
      Time to buy and time to lose
      yourself within
      a mornin' star

      Fifteen, I'm all right with you
      Fifteen, there's never
      a wish better than this
      When you've only got a hundred years to live

  - Bridge: |
      Half time goes by, suddenly you're wise
      Another blink of an eye, sixty-seven is gone

      The sun is getting high, we're moving on...

  - Interlude 2: |
      .. ..
      .. ..

  - Verse: |
      I'm ninety-nine for a moment
      And dyin' for just another moment

      And I'm just dreamin'
      Countin' the ways to where you are

  - Breakdown: |
      Fifteen, there's still time for you
      Twenty-two, I feel her too
      Thirty-three, you're on your way
      Every day's a new day

  - Pre-Outro: |
      Ooh-ooh, who, ooh-who-who
      Ooh-ooh, who, ooh-who-who
      Ooh-ooh, who, ooh-who-who,
      who-who-who

  - Chorus: |
      Fifteen, there's still time for you
      Time to buy and time to choose,

      Hey fifteen, there's never
      a wish better than this
      When you've only got a hundred years to live
