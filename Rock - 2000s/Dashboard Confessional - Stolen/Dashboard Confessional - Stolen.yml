      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      We watch the season pull up its own stakes
      And catch the last weekend of the last week

      Before the gold and the glimmer have been replaced
      Another sun soaked season fades away

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      You have stolen my
        heart

      You have stolen my
        heart

  - Verse 2: |
      Invitation-only grand farewells
      Crash the best one of the best ones

      Clear liquor and cloudy eyed
      Too early to say goodnight
      ....

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      You have stolen my
        heart

      You have stolen my
        heart

  - Chorus: |
      And from the ballroom floor, we are in celebration
      One good stretch before our hibernation

      Our dreams assured, and we all
      will sleep well, sleep well

  - Post-Chorus: |
      Sleep well
      sleep well

      sleep well
      ....

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      You have stolen,
      you have stolen

      You have stolen my
        heart

  - Chorus 2: |
      I watch you spin around in your highest heels
      You are the best one of the best ones

      And we all look like we
        feel

  - Post-Chorus 2: |
      You have stolen my,
      you have stolen my

      You have stolen my
      heart
