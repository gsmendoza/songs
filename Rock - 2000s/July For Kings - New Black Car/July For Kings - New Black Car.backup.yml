  - Intro: |
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      Waiting tables at your restaurant job
      An old man reads the paper in the booth where I stop
      To say hello when I'm in town, ask a friend
      if you're around

  - Verse: |
      And I'm thinkin' about those summer nights, we never slept we didn't mind
      And I felt so alive and happy
      Just sitting on the porch and swingin' back and forth
      Now everything seems so distant

  - Pre-chorus: |
      But I promise I'm not too far
      When you're alone in your brand new car
      Driving your new black car
      Into the rain

  - Chorus: |
      Are you listening to the radio?
      Are you driving down a city road?
      Are you alone in your new black car?
      I imagine you there

  - Verse 3: |
      And I'm sitting by the window here, the morning birds will reappear
      And I feel empty
      And our songs are on the radio, you call me up but I have to go
      And I'm sorry angel, I'm sorry

  - Pre-chorus: |
      But I'll call you right back, I swear
      You'll think I've left you there
      Alone with an empty chair
      But I whisper your name

  - Chorus: |
      Are you listening to the radio?
      Are you driving down a city road?
      Are you alone in your new black car?
      I imagine you there

  - Chorus: |
      Are you listening to the radio?
      Are you driving down a city road?
      Back alone in your new black car?
      The wind in your hair

  - Interlude: |
      .... ....
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      Are you tired of watching the rain hit the glass? All alone but aware of the places we've passed
      Together we were singing along to the songs. Are you now, are you now?
      I'm thinking of you in your college town. Are you thinking of me as you're driving around?
      Are you listening to me, are you listening?

  - Chorus: |
      Are you listening to the radio?
      Are you driving down a city road?
      Are you alone in your new black car?
      I imagine you there

  - Chorus 5: |
      Are you listening to the radio?
      Are you driving down a winding road?
      Are you alone in your new black car?
      The wind in your hair

  - Coda: |
      Alone in your new black car
      I imagine you there
      Driving your new black car
      The wind in your hair

      Are you listening to the *radio*?
      Are you listening to the *radio*?
      Are you listening to the *radio*?
      Are you listening to the *radio*?
