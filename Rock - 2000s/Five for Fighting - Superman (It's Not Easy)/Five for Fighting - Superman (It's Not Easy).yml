lyrics:
- Intro: |
    ....

- Verse: |-
    I can't stand to fly
    I'm not that naive
    I'm just out to find
    The better part of me

- Chorus A: |-
    I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane
    I'm more than some pretty face beside a train
    And it's not easy to be
    me

- Verse: |-
    Wish that I could cry
    Fall upon my knees
    Find a way to lie
    About a home I'll never see

- Chorus B: |-
    It may sound absurd, but don't be naive
    Even heroes have the right to bleed
    I may be disturbed, but won't you concede
    Even heroes have the right to dream
    And it's not easy to be
    me

- Bridge: |-
    Up, up and away, away from me
    Well, it's all right,
    you can all sleep sound tonight
    I'm not crazy
    Or anything

- Verse: |-
    I can't stand to fly
    I'm not that naive
    Men weren't meant to ride
    With clouds between their knees

- Chorus C: |-
    I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
    Digging for kryptonite on this one way street
    Only a man in a funny red sheet
    Looking for special things inside of me

- Chorus C: |-
    Inside of me
    Inside of me
    Inside of me
    Inside of me

- Chorus D: |-
    I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
    I'm only a man looking for a dream
    I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
    And it's not easy

- Outro: |-
    It's not easy to be

    Me
    ....

    ....
