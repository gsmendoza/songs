lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      Our hearts, are free
      So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
      I'm the flower, you're the bee
      It's much older than you and me

  - Verse: |
      I'm in love, I'm in life
      I belong to the stars and sky
      Let's forget who we are for one night
      We're like animals baby it's the people and I

  - Chorus : |
      I want real love, baby, ooh don't leave me waiting
      I got real love, baby, waiting til you taste me
      I want real love, baby, there's a world inside me
      Got the key just use it, just before I'm in it

  - Verse: |
      Our hearts, are free
      So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
      I'm the flower, you're the bee
      It's much older than you and me

  - Verse: |
      I'm in love, I'm in life
      I belong to the stars and sky
      Let's forget who we are for one night
      We're like animals baby it's the people and I
