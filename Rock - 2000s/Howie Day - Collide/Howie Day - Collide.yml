  - Verse: |
      The dawn is breaking
      A light shining through

      You're barely waking
      And I'm tangled up in you, Yeah

  - Interlude: |
      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo
      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo

  - Verse: |
      But I'm open, you're closed
      Where I follow, you'll go

      I worry I won't see your face
      Light up again

  - Chorus: |
      Even the best fall down sometime
      Even the wrong words seem to rhyme

      Out of the doubt that fills my mind
      I somehow find, you and I collide

  - Interlude: |
      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo
      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo

  - Verse: |
      I'm quiet, you're not
      You make a first impression

      But I've found I'm scared to know
      I'm always on your mind

  - Chorus: |
      Even the best fall down sometime
      Even the stars refuse to shine

      Out of the back you fall in time
      I somehow find, you and I collide

  - Bridge: |
      .. . .
      Don't stop here

      .. . .
      I lost my place

      .. . .
      I'm close behind

  - Solo: |
      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo
      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo

      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo
      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo

  - Chorus: |
      Even the best fall down sometimes
      Even the wrong words seem to rhyme

      Out of the doubt that fills your mind
      You finally find, You and I collide

  - Chorus: |
      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo,
      Finally find, You and I collide

      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo
      You finally find, You and I collide

  - Outro: |
      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo
      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo

      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo
      Doo-doo-doo-doo, Doo-doo-doo-doo
