lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .... ....
      .... ....

  - Verse A: |
      Smeared black ink.
      Your palms are sweaty. I'm barely listening
      To last demands.
      I'm staring at the asphalt wondering what's buried underneath.

      Where I am.
      .... ....
      Where I am.
      .... ....

  - Verse B: |
      I wear my badge.
      A vinyl sticker with big block letters adhering to my chest.
      It tells your new friends,
      "I am a visitor here. I am not permanent."
      The only thing
      Keeping me dry is

  - Chorus: |
      It seems so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex.
      A stranger with your door key explaining that "I'm just visiting".
      I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving.
      Why I was the one worth leaving.

  - Interlude: |
      .... ....
      DC sleeps alone tonight.

  - Solo: |
      .... ....
      .... ....
      .... ....
      .... ....

      .... ....
      .... ....
      .... ....
      .... ....

  - Chorus: |
      It seems so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex.
      A stranger with your door key explaining that "I'm just visiting".
      I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving.
      I was the one worth leaving.

  - Chorus: |
      The district sleeps alone tonight after the bars turn out their lights
      And send the autos swerving into the loneliest evening.
      I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving.
      Why I was the one worth leaving.

  - Outro: |
      Why I was the one worth leaving.
      Why I was the one worth leaving.
      .... ....
      .... ....
      .... ....
      .... ....
