  - Verse: |
      Let me in
      To see you in the morning light
      To get me on and all along
      the tears they come

      See all come
      I want you to believe in life
      But I get the strangest feeling
      that you've gone away

      Will you find out who you are
      too late to change

  - Chorus: |
      I wish I could be
      Every little thing
      you wanted
      All the time

      Ohhh, I wish I could be
      Every little thing
      you wanted
      All the time, sometimes

  - Verse: |
      Lift me up
      Just lift me up don't make a sound
      And let me hold you up before
      you hit the ground

      See all come
      You say your all right
      But I get the strangest feeling
      That you've gone away, you've gone away

      And will you find out who you are
      too late to change?

  - Chorus: |
      I wish I could be
      Every little thing
      you wanted
      All the time

      Ohhh, I wish I could be
      Every little thing
      you wanted
      Every little thing you wanted, everytime

  - Bridge: |
      Don't give me up
      ....
      Don't give me up
      tonight

      Or soon nothing will be right at all,
      Salvation
      Will you find out who you are
      too late to change?

  - Interlude: |
      ....
      Too late to change?

  - Outro: |
      Oh, I wish I could be
      Every little thing
      you wanted
      Every little thing you wanted, all the time

      This time
      Every little thing
      you wanted
      all the time

      Oohh..
      Every little thing
      you wanted
      all the time

      ....
      ....
      But I get the strangest feeling
      that you've gone away
