  - Verse: |
      So baby
      When I'm near you
      You can't feel me
      I'm lightnin'

  - Verse: |
      You used to come by
      And sit down by my side
      You would come in close
      And take off all my clothes

  - Chorus: |
      Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps
      You end up mad at me for makin' a mess
      I can't understand, why you don't understand me,
      Baby

      And every day I wake up and I make money for myself
      And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help
      Do you understand? You don't understand me,
      Baby

  - Verse 2: |
      All the ivy
      Is growing sideways
      You won't stop it
      'Til it covers all of our place

  - Chorus

      If I go right and you go left
      Hey, I know we'll meet up again

      .... ....

      And if you go left and I go right
      Hey, maybe that's just life sometimes
