lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. ..
      ....

      .. ..
      ....

  - Verse: |
      I found the pieces
      in my hand

      They were always there
      It just took some time for me to understand

      You gave me words
      I just can't say

      So if nothing else
      I'll just hold on while you drift away

  - Pre-chorus: |
      'Cause everything
      you wanted me to hide

      Is everything that
      makes me feel alive

  - Chorus: |
      The cities grow, the rivers flow
      Where you are, I never know

      But I'm still here
      ....

      If you were right and I was wrong
      Why are you the one who's gone?

      And I'm still here?
      Still here

  - Interlude: |
      .. ..
      ....

  - Verse: |
      I've seen the ashes
      in my heart

      I smile the widest
      When I cry inside and my insides blow apart

      I tried to wear
      another face

      Just to make you proud
      Just to make you put me in my place

  - Pre-chorus: |
      But everything
      you wanted from me

      Is everything that
      I could never be

  - Chorus: |
      The cities grow, the rivers flow
      Where you are, I never know

      But I'm still here
      ....

      If you were right and I was wrong
      Why are you the one who's gone?

      And I'm still here
      ....

  - Bridge: |
      Maybe tonight
      It's gonna be alright

      I will get better
      ....

      Maybe today
      It's gonna be okay

      I will remember
      ....
      ....

  - Verse 3: |
      I held the pieces
      of my soul

      I was shattered
      And I wanted you to come and make me whole

      Then I saw you
      yesterday

      But you didn't notice
      And you just walked away

  - Pre-chorus 3: |
      'Cause everything
      you wanted me to hide

      Is everything
      that makes me feel alive

  - Chorus: |
      The cities grow, the rivers flow
      Where you are, I never know

      But I'm still here
      ....

      If you were right and I was wrong
      Why are you the one who's gone?

      And I'm still here?
      ....

  - Chorus: |
      The lights go out, the bridges burn
      Once you're gone, you can't return

      But I'm still here
      ....

      Remember how you used to say
      I'd be the one to run away

      But I'm still here
      I'm still here

  - Outro: |
      ....
      I'm still here
      ....
      ....
