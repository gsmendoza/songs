Train - Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)


[Intro]
<C>---         ....
<G>---         ....
<F>---         ....
<F>---         ....

[Verse]
<C>---         Now that she's back in the atmosphere
<G>---         With drops of Jupiter in her hair
<F>---         ....
<F>---         ....

<C>---         She acts like summer and walks like rain
<G>---         Reminds me that there's a time to change
<F>---         ....
<F>---         ....

<C>---         Since the return from her stay on the moon
<G>---         She listens like spring and she talks like June
<F>---         ....
<F>---         ....

[Chorus]
<G>---         But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
<D>---         Did you make it to the Milky Way
<F>---         to see the lights all faded
<C>---         And that heaven is overrated?

<G>---         Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
<D>---         One without a permanent scar
<Dm>---        And did you miss me while you were
<F>---         looking for yourself out there

[Interlude]
<C>---         ....
<G>---         ....
<F>---         ....
<F>---         ....

[Verse]
<C>---         Now that she's back from that soul vacation
<G>---         Tracing her way through the constellation
<F>---         ....
<F>---         ....

<C>---         She checks out Mozart while she does taebo
<G>---         Reminds me that there's a room to grow
<F>---         ....
<F>---         ....

<C>---         Now that she's back in the atmosphere
<G>---         I'm afraid that she might think of me as
<F>---         plain old Jane told a story 'bout a man
<F>---         who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Chorus]
<G>---         But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
<D>---         Did you finally get the chance
<F>---         to dance along the light of day
<C>---         And head back to the Milky Way?

<G>---         And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
<D>---         Was it everything you wanted to find?
<Dm>---        And did you miss me while you were
<F>---         looking for yourself out there?

[Interlude]
<C>---         ....
<G>---         ....
<F>---         ....
<F>---         ....

[Bridge]
<C>---         Can you imagine no love, pride, deepfried chicken?
<G>---         Your best friend always
<F>---         sticking up for you
<F>---         even when I know you're wrong

<C>---         Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance,
<G>---         fivehour phone conversation?
<Bb>---        The best soy latte that you ever had
<F>---         and me

[Chorus 3]
<G>---         But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
<D>---         Did you finally get the chance
<F>---         to dance along the light of day
<C>---         And head back to the Milky Way?

<G>---         And tell me, did you sail across the sun?
<D>---         Did you make it to the Milky Way
<F>---         to see the lights all faded
<C>---         And that heaven is overrated?

<G>---         Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star,
<D>---         One without a permanent scar?
<Dm>---        And did you miss me while you were
<F>---         looking for yourself?

[Outro]
<C>---         Na na na na na na
<G>---         Na na na na na na
<F>---         And did you finally get the chance
<F>---         to dance along the light of day?

<C>---         Na na na na na na
<G>---         Na na na na na na
<F>---         And did you fall for a shooting star,
<F>---         fall for a shooting star?

<C>---         Na na na na na na
<G>---         Na na na na na na
<Bb>---        And now you're lonely looking for yourself
<F>---         out there.
