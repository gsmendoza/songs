  - Verse: |
      You were wrong
      You were right
      And you are gone
      Tonight

      You were free
      So alive
      You were wrong
      You were right

  - Verse: |
      And you were down
      You could see
      And you wore hearts
      For me

      You were sharp
      As sharp as knives
      You were wrong
      You were right

  - Pre-chorus: |
      Shot down, said you never had the chance
      Took a ride on a suicide romance
      Could have sworn there was somebody home
      To facilitate the great unknown

      Woman, I ain't going to
      meet you anywhere
      Don't know where I'm going yet
      But I sure am getting there

  - Chorus: |
      Shotgun fire, anybody home?
      I got two dimes in the telephone
      Alright
      No, it's not easy tonight

      Shotgun fire, anybody home?
      I got two dimes in the telephone
      Alright
      No, it's not easy tonight

  - Verse: |
      And you were bound
      You were free
      And you wear black
      For me

      You were dark
      As dark as night
      You were wrong
      Yeah, you were right

  - Pre-chorus: |
      Well, shot down, said you never had the chance
      Took a ride on a suicide romance
      Could have sworn there was somebody home
      To facilitate the great unknown

      Woman, I ain't going to
      meet you anywhere
      Don't know where I'm going yet
      No, but I sure am getting there

  - Chorus: |
      Shotgun fire, anybody home?
      I got two dimes in the telephone
      Alright
      No, it's not easy tonight

      Shotgun fire, anybody home?
      I got two dimes in the telephone
      Alright
      Hell, it's not easy tonight

  - Chorus: |
      She's in
      over my head
      And it's not easy,
      it's not easy tonight

      She's in
      over my head
      And it's not easy,
      it's not easy tonight

  - Chorus: |
      Shotgun fire, anybody home?
      I got two dimes in the telephone
      Alright
      It's not easy tonight

      Shotgun fire, anybody home?
      I got two dimes in the telephone
      Alright, yeah
