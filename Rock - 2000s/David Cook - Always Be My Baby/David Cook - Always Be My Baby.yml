lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      ....

  - Verse: |
      We were as one, babe
      For a moment in time
      And it seemed everlasting
      That you would always be mine

  - Verse: |
      Now you want to be free, yeah
      So I'm letting you fly
      'cause I know in my heart, babe
      Our love will never die, no

  - Break: |
      ....

  - Chorus: |
      You'll always be a part of me
      I'm part of you indefinitely
      Girl, don't you know you can't escape me
      Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

      And we'll linger on
      Time can't erase a feeling this strong
      No way, you're never gonna shake me
      Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

  - Post-Chorus Break: |
      ....
      ....

  - Verse: |
      I ain't gonna cry, no
      And I won't beg you to stay
      If you're determined to leave, girl
      I will not stand in your way

  - Verse: |
      But inevitably,
      You'll be back again
      'Cause you know in your heart, babe
      Our love will never end, no

  - Chorus: |
      You'll always be a part of me
      I'm part of you indefinitely
      Girl, don't you know you can't escape me
      Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

      And we'll linger on
      Time can't erase a feeling this strong
      No way, you're never gonna shake me
      Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

  - Bridge: |
      I know that
      you'll be back, girl
      When your days and your nights
      get a little bit colder, oh, oh

      I know that
      you'll be right back, baby
      Oh baby, believe me,
      it's only a matter of time

  - Down Chorus: |
      You'll always be a part of me
      I'm part of you indefinitely
      Girl, don't you know you can't escape me
      Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

      And we'll linger on
      Time can't erase a feeling this strong
      No way, you're never gonna shake me
      Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my,

      My baby
      ....

  - Chorus: |
      You will always be
      I'm part of you indefinitely
      Girl, don't you know you can't escape me
      Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

      And we'll linger on
      Time can't erase a feeling this strong
      No way, you're never gonna shake me
      Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
