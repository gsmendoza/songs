[Intro]
<D>---         ....
<Bm>---        ....
<A>---         ....
<G>---         ....

<D>---         ....
<Bm>---        ....
<A>---         ....
<G>---         ....

[Verse]
<D>---         Hope dangles on a string
<Bm>---        Like slow-spinning redemption
<A>---         Winding in, and winding out
<G>---         The shine of it has caught my eye

<D>---         And roped me in
<Bm>---        So mesmerizing
<A>---         So hypnotizing
<G>---         I am captivated, I am

[Chorus]
<D>---         Vindicated,
<G>---         I am selfish, I am wrong
<Bm>---        I am right, I swear I'm right
<A>---         Swear I knew it all along

<D>---         And I am flawed
<G>---         But I am cleaning up so well
<Bm>---        I am seeing in me now
<A>---         The things you swore you saw yourself

[Verse]
<D>---         So clear, like the diamond in your ring
<Bm>---        Cut to mirror your intention
<A>---         Oversized, and overwhelmed
<G>---         The shine of which has caught my eye

<D>---         And rendered me
<Bm>---        So isolated
<A>---         So motivated
<G>---         I am certain now that I am

[Chorus 2]
<D>---         Vindicated,
<G>---         I am selfish, I am wrong
<Bm>---        I am right, I swear I'm right
<A>---         Swear I knew it all along

<D>---         And I am flawed
<G>---         But I am cleaning up so well
<Bm>---        I am seeing in me now
<A>---         The things you swore you saw yourself

<A>---         ....

[Bridge]
<G>---         So turn
<Bm>---        up the corners of your lips
<A>---         Part them and feel my fingertips
<G>---         Trace the moment, fall forever

<G>---         Defense is paper-thin
<Bm>---        Just one touch, and I'd be in
<A>---         Too deep now to ever swim
<A>--!         against the current

[Interlude]
<D>---         So let me slip away
<Bm>---        So let me slip away
<A>---         So let me slip away
<G>---         So let me slip against the current

<D>---         So let me slip away
<Bm>---        So let me slip away
<A>---         So let me slip away
<G>---         So let me slip away

[Chorus]
<D>---         Vindicated,
<G>---         I am selfish, I am wrong
<Bm>---        I am right, I swear I'm right
<A>---         Swear I knew it all along

<D>---         And I am flawed
<G>---         But I am cleaning up so well
<Bm>---        I am seeing in me now
<A>---         The things you swore you saw yourself

[Outro]
<D>---         Like hope dangles on a string
<Bm>---        Like slow-spinning redemption
<D>...         ....
