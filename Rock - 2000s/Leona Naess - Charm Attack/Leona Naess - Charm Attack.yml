  - Verse 1: |
      He's the kind of guy
      who's always passing by
      who never has time to spend
      ...

      And he'll take you for a spin
      and won't look within
      to find out who you are
      ....

      And he numbs himself with weed
      He's from the coldest breed
      who judge by what they see
      ....

      And I thought he was smart enough to know
      That the girl on his arm
      will never calm his storms
      ....

  - Pre-Chorus 1: |
      Watch out
      he'll charm you

  - Chorus: |
      Smoother than the LA weather,
      that's how he holds himself together

      He is colder than the winter,
      I wrap my coat around to better

      Counteract his charm attack that
      leaves me hungry, well

      I'm no saviour but
      I tried to save you with

  - Post-Chorus 1: |
      All
      my
      love
      ....

      That's raging
      high
      inside
      ....

  - Verse 2: |
      And he has his minions
      with no real opinions
      'cause they all walk on glass
      ....

      And your lies become the truth
      and give me the proof
      that you really care
      ....

      With your gorgeous grin
      you had the world sucked in
      believing in everything you'd say
      ....

  - Pre-Chorus 2: |
      Watch out
      he'll charm you

  - Chorus: |
      And he stamps on every
      emotion

      And he dampens each and
      every explosion

      And he stamps on every
      emotion

      And he dampens each and
      every explosion

  - Chorus: |
      And he stamps on every
