  - Verse: |
      Don't touch the sleeping pills,
      they mess with my head
      Dredging up great white sharks,
      swimming in the bed

      Here comes a killer whale,
      to sing me to sleep
      Thrashing the covers off,
      has me by its teeth
      
  - Pre-Chorus: |
      And, oh, my love remind me,
      what was it that I said?
      I can't help but pull the earth around me
      to make my bed

      And, oh, my love remind me,
      what was it that I did?
      Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
      Did I build a ship to wreck?
      
  - Chorus: |
      To wreck,
      to wreck,
      to wreck
      Did I build this ship to wreck?
      
  - Verse: |
      What's with the long face?
      Do you want more?
      Thousands of red-eyed mice,
      scratching at the door

      And don't let the curtain catch you,
      cause you've been here before
      The chair is an island, darling,
      you can't touch the floor
      
  - Pre-Chorus
      
  - Chorus: |
      To wreck,
      to wreck,
      to wreck
      Did I build this ship to wreck?

  - Bridge: |
      And good God Under starless skies
      we are lost And into the breach
      we got tossed And the water's coming in
      fast
      
  - Pre-Chorus
