lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .... .. ..
      .... .. ..

  - Verse: |
      I find the map and draw a straight line
      Over rivers, farms, and state lines
      The distance from "A" to where you'd "B"
      It's only finger-lengths that I see
      I touch the place
      Where I'd find your face
      My fingers in creases
      Of distant dark places

  - Verse: |
      I hang my coat up in the first bar
      There is no peace that I've found so far
      The laughter penetrates my silence
      As drunken men find flaws in science
      Their words, mostly noises
      Ghosts with just voices
      Your words in my memory
      Are like music to me

  - Chorus: |
      And miles from where you are
      I lay down on the cold ground and I
      I pray that somethin' picks me up
      And sets me down in your warm arms

  - Break: |
      ....

  - Verse: |
      After I have travelled so far
      We'd set the fire to the third bar
      We'd share each other like an island
      Until exhausted, close our eyelids
      And dreaming, pick up from
      The last place we left off
      Your soft skin is weepin'
      A joy you can't keep in

  - Chorus: |
      And miles from where you are
      I lay down on the cold ground and I
      I pray that somethin' picks me up
      And sets me down in your warm arms

  - Chorus: |
      And miles from where you are
      I lay down on the cold ground and I
      I pray that somethin' picks me up
      And sets me down in your warm arms

  - Outro: |
