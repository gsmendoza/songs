  - Verse A: |
      When the moon lays his head on a pillow
      And the stars settle down for a rest,
      Just do me one small favour,  I beg you
      Please play me my baby's request

  - Verse B: |
      It's the song that we heard when we started.
      Now the birds have all flown from our nest
      But you could bring back memories departed
      By playing my baby's request

  - Middle 8: |
      My baby said
      That she knows how it goes but you're the one that really knows
      So go ahead
      Just one more time and then we'll go to bed

  - Verse B: |
      .. . . .. ..
      .. .. .. ..
      But you could bring back memories departed
      By playing my baby's request

  - Verse C: |
      When the moon lays his head on a pillow
      And the stars settle down for a rest,
      Just do me one small favour,  I beg you
      Please play me my baby's request

  - Outro: |
      Hmm play me baby's request
      Please play me my baby's request
      . . . . . .
      One more time
