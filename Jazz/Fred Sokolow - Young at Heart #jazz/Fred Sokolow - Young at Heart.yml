  - Verse 1: |
      Fairy tales can come true,
      it can happen to you
      when you’re young at heart.
      ....

      For it’s hard, you will find,
      to be narrow of mind,
      if you’re young at heart.
      ....

      You can go to extremes
      with impossible schemes.
      You can laugh when your dreams
      fall apart at the seams.

      And life gets more exciting
      with each passing day,
      and love is either in your heart
      or on its way.

  - Verse 2: |
      Don’t you know that it’s worth
      every treasure on earth
      to be young at heart?
      ....

      For as rich as you are,
      it’s much better by far
      to be young at heart.
      ....

      And if you should survive
      to a hundred and five,
      think of all you’ll derive
      out of being alive.

      And here is the best part:
      You’ll have a head start,
      if you are among the
      very young at heart.

      .. ..
      ....
