  - Verse: |
      Heart and soul, I fell in love with you,
      Heart and soul, the way a fool would do,
      Madly, because you held me tight,
      And stole a kiss in the night...

  - Verse: |
      Heart and soul, I begged to be adored,
      Lost control, and tumbled overboard,
      Gladly, that magic night we kissed,
      There in the moon mist.

  - Bridge: |
      Oh! but your lips were thrilling,
      much too thrilling,
      Never before were mine so
      strangely willing.

  - Verse: |
      But now I see, what one embrace can do,
      Look at me, it's got me loving you,
      Madly, that little kiss you
      stole, held all my heart and soul.

      Madly, that little kiss you

      heart and
      soul.
