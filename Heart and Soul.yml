lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      Heart and soul, I fell in love with you,
      Heart and soul, the way a fool would do,
      Madly...
      Because you held me tight,
      And stole a kiss in the night...

  - Verse: |
      Heart and soul, I begged to be adored,
      Lost control, and tumbled overboard,
      Gladly...
      That magic night we kissed,
      There in the moon mist.

  - Bridge: |
      Oh! but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling,
      Never before were mine so strangely willing.

  - Verse: |
      But now I see, what one embrace can do,
      Look at me, it's got me loving you,
      Madly...
      That little kiss you stole,
      Held all my heart and soul.
