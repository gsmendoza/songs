  - Verse A: |
      It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
      Everywhere you go
      Take a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again,
      With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

  - Verse B: |
      It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
      Toys in every store
      But the prettiest sight to see, is the holly that will be,
      On your own front door

  - Bridge: |
      A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
        is the wish of Barney and Ben
      Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
        is the hope of Janice and Jen
      And Mom and Dad can hardly wait
        for school to start again

  - Verse A: |
      It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
      Everywhere you go
      There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
      The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

  - Verse B: |
      It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
      Soon the bells will start
      And the thing that will make them ring, is the carol that you sing,
      Right within your heart

  - Coda: |
      It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
      Toys in every store
      But the prettiest sight to see, is the holly that will be,
      On your own front door
      For it's Christmas once more!
