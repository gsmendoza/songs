  - Verse: |
      O come, all ye faithful
      Joyful and triumphant
      O come ye, oh come ye to
      Bethlehem
      Come and behold Him
      Born the king of angels

  - Chorus: |
      Oh come let us adore Him
      Oh come let us adore Him
      Oh come let us adore Him
      Christ the Lord

  - Verse: |
      Sing, Choirs of angels
      Sing in exultation
      Sing all ye citizens of
      heaven above!
      Glory to God
      Glory in the highest

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      Yea, Lord we greet thee
      Born this happy morning
      Jesus to Thee be all
      glory given
      Word of the Father
      Now in flesh appearing

  - Chorus
