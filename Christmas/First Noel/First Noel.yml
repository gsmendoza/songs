lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      The First Noel, the Angels did say
      Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
      In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
      On a cold winter's night that was so deep

  - Chorus: |
      Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
      Born is the King of Israel!

  - Verse: |
      They looked up and saw a star
      Shining in the East beyond them far
      And to the earth it gave great light
      And so it continued both day and night

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      And by the light of that same star
      Three Wise men came from country far
      To seek for a King was their intent
      And to follow the star wherever it went.

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      This star drew nigh to the northwest
      O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
      And there it did both Pause and stay
      Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      Then entered in those Wise men three
      Full reverently upon their knee
      And offered there in His presence
      Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      Then let us all with one accord
      Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
      That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
      And with his blood mankind has bought.

  - Chorus
