  - Verse: |
      Her hair is Harlowe gold,
      her lips a sweet surprise
      Her hands are never cold,
      she's got Bette Davis eyes
      She'll turn the music on you,
      you won't have to think twice
      She's pure as New York snow,
      she's got Bette Davis eyes

  - Chorus: |
      And she'll tease you, she'll unease you,
      All the better just to please you,
      She's precocious, and she knows just what it
      takes to make a pro blush
      She's got Greta Garbo's standoff sighs
      She's got Bette Davis eyes

  - Intermission: |

      (2)---

  - Verse: |
      She'll let you take her home,
      you whet her appetite
      She'll lay you on her throne,
      she's got Bette Davis eyes
      She'll take a tumble on you
      Roll you like you were dice,
      Until you come up blue,
      she's got Bette Davis eyes

  - Chorus: |
      She'll expose you, when she snows you
      Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
      She's ferocious and she knows just what it
      takes to make a pro blush
      All the boys think she's a spy
      She's got Bette Davis eyes

  - Outro: |
      And she'll tease you,
      she'll unease you,
      Just to please you,
      she's got Bette Davis eyes
      She'll expose you,
      when she snows you,
      And she knows you,
      she's got Bette Davis eyes
