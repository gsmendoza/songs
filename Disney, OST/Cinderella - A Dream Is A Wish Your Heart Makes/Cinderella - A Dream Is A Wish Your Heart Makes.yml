lyrics:
  - Verse 1: |
      A dream is a wish your heart makes
      When you're fast asleep
      In dreams you will lose your heartache
      Whatever you wish for you keep

  - Verse 2: |
      Have faith in your dreams and someday
      Your rainbow will come smiling through
      No matter how your heart is grieving, if you keep on believing
      the dream that you wish will come true
