  - Verse 1: |
      You've got a friend in me
      You've got a friend in me

      When the road looks rough ahead
      And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
      You just remember what your old pal said

      Boy, you've got a friend in me
      Yeah, you've got a friend in me

  - Interlude: |
      .. .. .. ..
      .. ..

  - Verse 2: |
      You've got a friend in me
      You've got a friend in me

      You got troubles, I got them too
      There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
      We stick together, we can see it through

      Cause you've got a friend in me
      You've got a friend in me
 
  - Bridge: |
      Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
      Bigger and stronger too, maybe
      But none of them will ever love you
      The way I do, it's me and you, boy
 
  - Verse 3: |
      And as the years go by,
      Our friendship will never die

      You're gonna see it's our des-ti-ny

      You've got a friend in me
      You've got a friend in me
      You've got a friend in me
