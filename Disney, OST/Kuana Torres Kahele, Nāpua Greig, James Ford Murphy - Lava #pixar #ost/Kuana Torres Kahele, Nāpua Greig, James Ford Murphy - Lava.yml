lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .... ....
      .... .. ....

  - Verse A: |
      A long, long time ago, there was a volcano
      Living all alone in the middle of the sea

      He sat high above his bay watching all the couples play
      And wishing that he had someone too

      And from his lava came this song of hope that he sang
      Out loud every day for years and years

  - Chorus: |
      I have a dream I hope will come true
      That you're here with me and I'm here with you

      I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above-a
      Will send me someone to lava

  - Interlude A: |
      .... ....
      ....

  - Verse B: |
      Years of singing all alone turned his lava into stone
      Until he was on the brink of extinction

      But little did he know that living in the sea below
      Another volcano was listening to his song

      Every day she heard his tune, her lava grew and grew
      Because she believed his song was meant for her

      Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea
      As he sang his song of hope for the last time

  - Chorus

  - Interlude B: |
      ....

  - Verse A: |
      Rising from the sea below stood a lovely volcano
      Looking all around but she could not see him

      He tried to sing to let her know that she was not there alone
      But with no lava, his song was all gone

      He filled the sea with his tears and watched his dreams disappear
      As she remembered what his song meant to her

  - Chorus

  - Interlude C: |
      .... ....

  - Verse C: |
      Oh, they were so happy to finally meet above the sea
      All together now, their lava grew and grew

      No longer are they all alone with aloha as their new home
      And when you visit them, this is what they sing

  - Chorus: |
      I have a dream I hope will come true
      That you'll grow old with me, and I'll grow old with you

      We thank the earth, sea, and the sky we thank too
      I lava you

  - Outro: |
      I lava you
      I lava you
