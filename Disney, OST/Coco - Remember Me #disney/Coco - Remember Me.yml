lyrics:
  - Verse 1: |
      Remember me
      Though I have to say goodbye
      Remember me
      Don't let it make you cry

      For even if I'm far away
      I hold you in my heart
      I sing a secret song to you
      Each night we are apart

  - Verse 2: |
      Remember me
      Though I have to travel far
      Remember me
      Each time you hear a sad guitar

      Know that I'm with you
      The only way that I can be
      Until you're in my arms again
      Remember me
