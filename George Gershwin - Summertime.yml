lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      Summertime
      And the livin' is easy
      Fish are jumpin'
      And the cotton is high
      Your daddy's rich
      And your mamma's good lookin'
      So hush little baby
      Don't you cry

  - Verse: |
      One of these mornings
      You're going to rise up singing
      Then you'll spread your wings
      And you'll take to the sky
      But till that morning
      There's a'nothing can harm you
      With daddy and mamma
      Standing by
