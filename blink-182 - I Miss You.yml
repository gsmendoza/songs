  - Verse 1: |
      Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
      The shadow in the background of the morgue
      The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
      We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
      Where you can always find me, We'll have Halloween on Christmas
      And in the night we'll wish this never ends, we'll wish this never ends

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      ...
      (I miss you, miss you)
      ...
      (I miss you, miss you)
      (pause)

  - Verse 2: |
      Where are you and I'm so sorry
      I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
      I need somebody and always this sick strange darkness
      Comes creeping in so haunting every time.
      And as I stared I counted webs from all the spiders
      Catching things and eating their insides
      Like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason
      Will you come home and stop this pain tonight, stop this pain tonight

  - Chorus: |
      Don't waste your time on me you're already
      The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
      Don't waste your time on me you're already
      The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
