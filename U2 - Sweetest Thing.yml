  - Verse: |
      My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
      (Oh, the sweetest thing.)
      But she won't catch me or break my fall.
      (Oh, the sweetest thing.)
      Baby's got blue skies up ahead
      But in this, I'm a raincloud
      You know she wants a dry kind of love.
      (Oh, the sweetest thing.)

  - Chorus 1: |
      I'm losin' you,
      I'm losin' you. Ain't love the sweetest thing?

  - Verse: |
      I wanted to run, but she made me crawl
      (Oh, the sweetest thing.)
      Eternal fire, she turned me to straw.
      (Oh, the sweetest thing.)
      I know I got black eyes but they burn
      So brightly for her
      I guess it's a blind kind of love.
      (Oh, the sweetest thing.)

  - Chorus 2: |
      I'm losin' you,
      I'm losin' you.
      Ain't love the sweetest thing?
      Ain't love the sweetest thing?

  - Verse: |
      Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl.
      (Oh, the sweetest thing.)
      You can sew it up, but you still see the tear.
      (Oh, the sweetest thing.)
      Baby's got blue skies up ahead
      But in this, I'm a rain-cloud,
      Ours is a stormy kind of love.
      (Oh, the sweetest thing.)
