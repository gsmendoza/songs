lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      My love she throws me like a rubber ball
      (Ohhhhhh the sweetest thing)
      But she won't catch me or break my fall
      (Ohhhhhh the sweetest thing)
      Baby's got blue skies over head
      but in this I'm a rain cloud
      You know she likes a dry kind of love
      (Ohhhhhh the sweetest thing)

  - Chorus 1: |
      I'm losing you
      I'm losing you

  - Verse: |
      I wanted to run she made me crawl
      (Ohhhhhh the sweetest thing)
      Eternal fire, she turned me to straw
      (Ohhhhhh the sweetest thing)
      You know I got black eyes,
      but they burn so brightly for her
      Mine is a blind kind of love
      (Ohhhhhh the sweetest thing)

  - Chorus 2: |
      I'm losing you
      I'm losing you
      Ain't love the sweetest thing
      Ain't love the sweetest thing

  - Verse: |
      Blue eyed boy meets a brown eyed girl
      (Ohhhhhh the sweetest thing)
      You can sew it up but you still see the tear
      (Ohhhhhh the sweetest thing)
      Baby's got blue skies over head
      and in this I'm a rain cloud
      You know we got a stormy kind of love
      (Ohhhhhh the sweetest thing)
