lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      The First Noel, the Angels did say
      Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
      In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
      On a cold winter's night that was so deep

  - Chorus: |
      Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
      Born is the King of Israel!

  - Verse: |
      They looked up and saw a star
      Shining in the East beyond them far
      And to the earth it gave great light
      And so it continued both day and night

  - Chorus: |
      Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
      Born is the King of Israel!
