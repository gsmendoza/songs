lyrics: 
  - Intro: |
      ....
      ....

  - Verse: |
      I'm gonna make a change
      For once in my life
      ....
      ....

      It's gonna feel real good
      Gonna make a difference
      Gonna make it right
      ....

  - Verse: |
      As I, turn up the collar on
      My favorite winter coat
      This wind is blowin' my mind
      ....

      I see the kids in the street
      With not enough to eat
      Who am I, to be blind
      pretending not to see their needs?

  - Pre-chorus: |
      A summer's disregard
      A broken bottle top
      And a one man's soul
      ....

      They follow each other
      on the wind ya know
      'Cause they got nowhere to go
      That's why I want you to know

  - Chorus: |
      I'm starting with the
      man in the mirror

      I'm asking him to
      change his ways

      And no message
      could've been any clearer

      If they wanna make the world a better place
      Take a look at yourself and then make a change

  - Interlude: |
      .. ..
      .. Na-na-na, Na-na-na
      Nana-nana
      ....

  - Verse: |
      I've been a victim of
      a selfish kind of love
      It's time that I realize
      ....

      That there are some with no home
      Not a nickel to loan
      Could it be really me
      pretending that they're not alone?

  - Pre-chorus: |
      A willow deeply scarred
      Somebody's broken heart
      And a washed out dream
      ....

      They follow the pattern
      of the wind, ya see
      'Cause they got no place to be
      That's why I'm starting with me

  - Chorus: |
      I'm starting with the
      man in the mirror (who?)

      I'm asking him to
      change his ways (who?)

      And no message
      could've been any clearer

      If you wanna make the world a better place
      Take a look at yourself and then make a change

  - Chorus: |
      I'm starting with the
      man in the mirror (who?)

      I'm asking him to
      change his ways (who?)

      And no message
      could've been any clearer

      If you wanna make the world a better place
      Take a look at yourself and then make that

  - Chorus (G#, extended): |
      Change. I'm starting with the
      man in the mirror (oh yeah)

      I'm asking him to
      change his ways (better change)

      No message
      could've been any clearer

      If you wanna make the world a better place
      Take a look at yourself and then make the change

      You gotta get it right, while you got the time
      Cause when you close your heart, then you close your, your mind

  - Chorus (G#): |
      With the
      man in the mirror, oh yeah

      I'm asking him to
      change his ways (better change)

      No message
      could've been any clearer

      If you wanna make the world a better place
      Take a look at yourself and then make a change

  - Interlude (G#): |
      .. ..
      .. Na-na-na, Na-na-na
      Nana-nana
      ....

      .. ..
      .. Na-na-na, Na-na-na
      Nana-nana (Oooh)
      ....

  - Outro: |

      It's gonna feel
      real good, chime on
      (change), Just lift

      You've got to stop it
      Yourself (yeah,
