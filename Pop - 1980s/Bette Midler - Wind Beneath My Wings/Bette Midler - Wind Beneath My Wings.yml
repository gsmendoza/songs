lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .... ....
      .... ....

  - Verse 1: |
      It must have been cold there in my shadow
      To never have sunlight on your face
      You were content to let me shine, that's your way
      You always walked a step behind

  - Verse 2: |
      So I was the one with all the glory
      While you were the one with all the strength
      A beautiful face without a name for so long
      A beautiful smile to hide the pain

  - Chorus: |
      Did you ever know that you're my hero
      And everything I would like to be?
      I can fly higher than an eagle
      For you are the wind beneath my wings

      .... ....

  - Verse 2: |
      It might have appeared to go unnoticed
      But I've got it all here in my heart
      I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
      I would be nothing without you

  - Chorus 2: |
      Did you ever know that you're my hero?
      You're everything I wish I could be
      I could fly higher than an eagle
      For you are the wind beneath my wings

      Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
      You're everything, everything I wish I could be
      Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
      For you are the wind beneath my wings

      Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

  - Outro: |
      Oh, the wind beneath my wings
      You, you, you,
      you are the wind beneath my wings

      Fly,
      fly,
      fly away,
      you let me fly so high
      Oh, you, you, you,
      the wind beneath my wings
      Oh, you, you, you,
      the wind beneath my wings

      Fly,
      fly,
      so high against the sky,
      so high I almost touch the sky
      Thank you, thank you,
      Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings

      ....
