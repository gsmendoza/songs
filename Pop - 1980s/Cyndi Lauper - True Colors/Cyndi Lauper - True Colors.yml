  - Verse: |
      You with the sad eyes
      Don't be discouraged
      Oh I realize

      It's hard to take courage
      In a world full of people
      You can lose sight of it all

      And the darkness inside you
      Can make you feel so small

  - Chorus: |
      But I see your true colors
      Shining through

      I see your true colors
      And that's why I love you

      So don't be afraid
      to let them show

      Your true colors
      True colors

      are beautiful

  - Verse: |
      Show me a smile then
      Don't be unhappy,
      can't remember when

      I last saw you laughing
      If this world makes you crazy
      And you've taken all you can bear

      You call me up
      Because you know I'll be there

  - Chorus: |
      And I'll see your true colors
      Shining through

      I see your true colors
      And that's why I love you

      So don't be afraid
      to let it show

      Your true colors
      True colors

      are beautiful

      (Can't remember when I

      If this world makes you crazy
      And you've taken all you can bear

      You call me up
      Because you know I'll be there

  - Last Chorus: |
      And I'll see your true colors
      Shining through

      I see your true colors
      And that's why I love you

      So don't be afraid

      Your true colors
      True colors

      True colors
      Are shining through

      I see your true colors
      And that's why I love you

      So don't be afraid
      to let them show

      Your true colors
