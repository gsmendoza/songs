lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      ....
      . . ..

  - Verse: |
      You,
      I know you`re everything
      that I've been looking
      for

      And I,
      I look into your eyes
      And could not ask
      for more

  - Pre-chorus: |
      So it`s only fair to lay it
      on the line

      Hold on, I`m gonna need
      a little time

  - Chorus: |
      But if I ever fall in love
      again

      Sometimes when this broken heart
      can mend

      I know it`s gonna be with you
      You`re the one to pull me through
      Though I don`t know when

      If I ever fall in love again

  - Interlude: |
      ....
      . ...
      ....


  - Verse: |
      Scared,
      I guess I`m scared to fly
      It`s such a long way
      down

      And yet,
      if you`d just trust in me
      I`m sure, I`d come
      around

  - Pre-chorus: |
      And I know when you`re hurt
      It`s hard to let someone inside

      In your arms I feel I`m ready now
      to try

  - Chorus 2: |
      Do if I ever fall in love
      again

      Sometimes when this broken heart
      can mend

      I know it`s gonna be with you
      You`re the one to pull me through
      Though I don`t know when

      If I ever fall in love again
      ....

  - Bridge: |
      I`d be a fool to ever let you
      go

      You`re the best thing in my life
      When I know I've gotta take it slow

  - Solo: |
      ....

      ....

  - Chorus 3: |
      I know it`s gonna be with you
      You`re the one to pull me through
      Though I don`t know when

      If I ever fall in love again
      ....

      If I ever fall in love again
