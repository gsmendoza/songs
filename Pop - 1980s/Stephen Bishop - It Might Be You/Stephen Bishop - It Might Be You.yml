  - Verse: |
      Time, I've been passing time
      Watching trains go by, all of my life

      Lying on the sand
      Watching sea birds fly

  - Pre-chorus: |
      Wishing there would be
      Someone waiting home for me

  - Chorus: |
      Something's telling me it might be you
      It's telling me it might be you, all of my life

  - Verse: |
      Looking back as lovers
      Go walking past, all of my life

      Wondering how they met
      And what makes it last

  - Pre-chorus: |
      If I found the place
      Would I recognize the face?

  - Chorus: |
      Something's telling me it might be you
      Yeah, it's telling me it might be you

  - Bridge: |
      So many quiet walks
      to take, So many dreams
      to wake. And with so much love
      to make, oh

      I think we're gonna need
      some time, Maybe all we need
      is time

      And it's telling me it might be you, all of my life

  - Verse: |
      .. ..
      .. ..

      I've been saving love songs
      and lullabies

  - Pre-chorus: |
      And there's so much more
      No one's ever heard before

  - Last Chorus: |
      Something's telling me it might be you
      Yeah, it's telling me it must be you
      And I'm feeling it'll just be you, all of my life

  - Outro: |
      It's you,
      it's you, I've been waiting for all of my life

      Maybe it's you,
      it's you, I've been waiting for all of my life

      Maybe it's you
      Maybe it's you, I've been waiting for all of my life

      Maybe it's you
      Maybe it's you, I've been waiting for all of my life
