  - Verse 1: |
      What can you lose?
      Only the blues

      Why keep concealing everything you're feeling?
      Say it to her, what can you lose?

      Maybe it shows, she's had clues, 
      which she chose to ignore

      Maybe though she knows, 
      and just wants to go on as before
      
      As a friend, nothing more
      So she closes the door

  - Verse 2: |
      Well, if she does
      Those are the dues
      
      Once the words are spoken, something may be broken      
      Still, you love her. What can you lose?

      But what if she goes? At least now, you have part of her
      What if she had to choose?

  - Verse 3: |
      Leave it alone
      Hold it all in

      Better a bone, don't even begin
      With so much to win

      There's too much to lose
