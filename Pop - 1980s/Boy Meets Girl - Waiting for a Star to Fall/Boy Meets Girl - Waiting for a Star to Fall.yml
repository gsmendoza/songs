  - Verse: |
      I hear your name whispered on the wind
      It's a sound that makes me cry
      I hear a song blow again and again
      Through my mind and I don't know why

      I wish I didn't feel so strong about you
      Like happiness and love revolve around you

  - Pre-chorus: |
      Trying to catch your heart
      Is like trying to catch a star

      So many people love you, baby
      That must be what you are

  - Chorus: |
      Waiting for a star to fall and carry
      your heart into my arms, that's where you belong
      In my arms, baby, yeah

      Waiting for a star to fall and carry
      your heart into my arms, that's where you belong
      In my arms, baby, yeah

  - Verse: |
      I've learn to feel what I cannot see
      But with you, I lose that vision
      I don't know how to dream your dream
      So I'm all caught up in the superstition

      I want to reach out and pull you to me
      Who says I should let a wild one go free

  - Pre-chorus: |
      Trying to catch your heart
      Is like trying to catch a star

      But I can't love you this much, baby
      And love you from this far

  - Chorus

  - Bridge: |
      Waiting (however long)
      I don't like waiting (I'll wait for you)

      It's so hard waiting (don't be too long)
      Seems like waiting makes me love you
      Even more
