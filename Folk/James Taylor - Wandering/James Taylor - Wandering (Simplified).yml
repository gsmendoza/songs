  - Verse: |
      I've been wandering
      early and late

      From New York City
      to the Golden Gate

      And it don't look like
      I'll ever stop my
      wandering

  - Verse: |
      My daddy was an engineer
      My brother drives a hack

      My sister takes in laundry
      while the baby balls the jack

      And it don't look like
      I'll ever stop my
      wandering

  - Interlude

  - Verse: |
      I've been in the army
      I worked on a farm

      And all I've got to show
      is the muscle in my arm

      And it don't look like
      I'll ever stop my
      wandering

  - Interlude

  - Verse: |
      My ma', she died
      when I was young

      My daddy took to stealing
      and he got hung

      And it don't look like
      I'll ever stop my
      wandering

  - Interlude

  - Verse: |
      Snakes in the ocean
      Eels in the sea

      I let a redheaded woman
      make a fool out of me

      And it don't look like
      I'll ever stop my
      wandering

  - Interlude

  - Last Verse: |
      Well, I've been wandering
      early and late

      From the New York City
      to the Golden Gate

      And it don't look like
      I'll ever stop my
      wandering

      ..
      ..

      No, it don't look like
      I'll ever stop my
      wandering
