      Well, I know it's kind of late
      I hope I didn't wake you
      But what I got to say can't wait
      I know you'd understand

      The words just came out wrong
      So I'll have to say I love you
      In a song

      Yeah, I know it's kind of strange
      Every time I'm near you
      I just run out of things to say
      I know you'd understand
