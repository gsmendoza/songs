lyrics:
- Intro: |
    .... ....
    .... ....

- Verse: |-
    I took my love, I took it down
    I climbed a mountain and I turned around
    And I saw my reflection in the snowcovered hills
    'Till the landslide brought me down

- Verse: |-
    Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
    Can the child within my heart rise above?
    Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
    Can I handle the seasons of my life?

- Interlude: |
    .... ....
    Mmm.

- Chorus: |-
    Well, I've been afraid of changing
    'Cause I've built my life around you
    But time makes you bolder, even children get older
    And I'm getting older too

- Solo: |
    .... ....
    .... ....
    .... ....
    .... ....

- Chorus: |-
    Well, I've been afraid of changing
    'Cause I've built my life around you
    But time makes you bolder, even children get older
    And I'm getting older too

- Tag: |
    Oh I'm getting older too

- Verse: |-
    Ah, take my love, take it down
    Ah, climb a mountain and turn around
    And if you see my reflection in the snowcovered hills
    Well the landslide will bring it down

- Outro: |
    And if you see my reflection in the snowcovered hills
    Well the landslide will bring it down Oh
    the landslide will bring it down
