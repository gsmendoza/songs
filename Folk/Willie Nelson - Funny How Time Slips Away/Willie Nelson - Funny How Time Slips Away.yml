  - Verse: |
      Well hello there
      My, it's been a
      long, long time
      ....

      How am I doing?
      Oh, I guess that I'm
      doing fine
      ....

      It's been so long now
      But it seems now
      That it was only
      Yesterday

      Gee, ain't it funny
      How time
      Slips away
      ....

  - Verse: |
      How's your new love?
      I hope that's he's
      doing fine
      ....

      I heard you told him
      That you'd love him till the end
      of time
      ....

      Now's that the same thing
      That you told me
      Seems like
      Just the other day

      Gee, ain't it funny
      How time
      Slips away
      ....

  - Last Verse: |
      I gotta go now
      I guess I'll see you
      Around
      ...

      Don't know when though
      Never know when I'll be
      Back in town
      ....

      But remember
      What I tell you
      That in time
      You're gonna pay

      And it's surprising
      How time
      Slips away
      .. ....
