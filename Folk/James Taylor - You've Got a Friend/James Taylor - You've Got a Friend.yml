lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. ..
      .. ..

  - Verse: |
      When you're down and troubled
      and you need a helping hand
      And nothing, whoa,
      nothing is going right

      Close your eyes and think of me
      and soon I will be there
      To brighten up even your darkest
      nights

  - Chorus: |
      You just call out my name
      And you know wherever I am
      I'll come running, oh yeah baby,
      To see you again

      Winter, spring, summer or fall
      All you got to do is call
      And I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah

  - Re-Intro: |
      You've got a friend
      .. ..

  - Verse: |
      If the sky above you
      should turn dark and full of clouds
      And that old. north wind should begin
      to blow

      Keep your head together
      and call my name out loud now
      Soon I'll be knocking upon your
      door

  - Chorus: |
      You just call out my name
      And you know wherever I am
      I'll come running, oh yes I will,
      To see you again

      Winter, spring, summer or fall
      All you got to do is call
      And I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah

  - Bridge: |
      Hey, ain't it good to know that you've got a friend?
      People can be so cold
      They'll hurt you and desert you
      Well, they'll take your soul if you let them, Oh yeah,
      But don't you let them

  - Chorus: |
      You just call out my name
      And you know wherever I am
      I'll come running,
      To see you again, Oh baby, don't you know about

      Winter, spring, summer or fall
      Hey now, all you got to do is call
      Lord, I'll be there, yes I will

  - Outro: |
      You've got a friend,
      You've got a friend, ain't it good to know
      You've got a friend, ain't it good to know
      you've got a friend, Oh, yeah, yeah,
      you've got a friend
