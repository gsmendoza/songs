lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. .. ..
      .. .. ..
      .. .. ..
      .. .. ..

  - Verse: |
      Well, I hope that I don't fall in love with you
      .. .. ..
      Cause falling in love just makes me blue
      .. .. ..

  - Chorus: |
      Well, the music plays and you display
      your heart for me to see
      I had a beer and now I hear you
      calling out for me
      .. .. And I
      hope that I don't fall in love with you
      .. .. ..

  - Verse: |
      Well, the room is crowded, people everywhere
      .. .. ..
      And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
      .. .. ..

  - Chorus: |
      Well, if you sit down with this old clown
      I'll take that frown and break it
      Before the evening's gone away
      I think that we can make it
      .. .. And I
      hope that I don't fall in love with you
      .. .. ..

  - Verse: |
      Well, the night does funny things inside a man
      .. .. ..
      These old tomcat feelings you don't understand
      .. .. ..


  - Chorus: |
      Well, I turn around to look at you,
      you light a cigarette
      I wish I had the guts to bum one,
      but we've never met
      .. .. And I
      hope that I don't fall in love with you
      .. .. ..

  - Verse: |
      Well, I can see that you are lonesome just like me
      .. .. ..
      And it being late, you'd like some company
      .. .. ..

  - Chorus: |
      Well, I turn around to look at you,
      and you look back at me
      The guy you're with he's up and split,
      the chair next to you is free
      .. .. And I
      hope that you don't fall in love with me
      .. .. ..

  - Last Verse: |
      Now it's closing time,
      .. the music's fading out
      .. .. ..
      Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout
      .. .. ..

  - Last Chorus: |
      I turn around to look at you,
      you're nowhere to be found
      I search the place for your lost face,
      guess I'll have another round
      .. .. And I
      think that I just fell in love with you
      .. .. ....
