  - Verse: |
      Well the moon is broken and the sky is cracked
      Come on up to the house
      The only things that you can see is all that you lack
      Come on up to the house

      All your cryin don't do no good
      Come on up to the house
      Come down off the cross, we can use the wood
      You gotta come on up to the house

  - Chorus: |
      Come on up to the house
      Come on up to the house
      The world is not my home, I'm just a passing thru
      You gotta come on up to the house

  - Interlude: |
      ....

  - Verse: |
      There's no light in the tunnel, no irons in the fire
      Come on up to the house
      And you're singin lead soprano in a junkman's choir
      You gotta come on up to the house

      Does life seem nasty, brutish and short
      Come on up to the house
      The seas are stormy and you can't find no port
      Got to come on up to the house

  - Chorus: |
      You gotta come on up to the house
      Come on up to the house
      The world is not my home, I'm just a passing thru
      Come on up to the house

  - Instrumental: |

  - Chorus: |
      You gotta come on up to the house
      Come on up to the house
      The world is not my home, I'm just a passing thru
      Come on up to the house

  - Verse: |
      There's nothin in the world that you can do
      You gotta come on up to the house
      And you been whipped by the forces that are inside you
      Gotta come on up to the house

      Well you're high on top of your mountain of woe
      Gotta come on up to the house
      Well you know you should surrender but you can't let it go
      You gotta come on up to the house

  - Coda: |
      Gotta come on up to the house
      Gotta come on up to the house
      The world is not my home, I'm just a passing thru
      You gotta come on up to the house
      You gotta come on up to the house
      You gotta come on up to the house
      Yeah
      ....
