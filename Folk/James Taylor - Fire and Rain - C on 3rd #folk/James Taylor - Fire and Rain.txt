James Taylor - Fire and Rain

Key of C (Capo on 3rd)

[Intro]
<A>- <G>- <D>- <A>-     ...
<A>- <E>- <G>---        ...

[Verse]
<A>- <Em>- <D>- <A>-    Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
<A>- <E>- <G>---        Susanne the plans they made put an end to you
<A>- <Em>- <D>- <A>-    I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
<A>- <E>- <G>---        I just can't remember who to send it to

[Chorus]
<D>- <Bm>- <A>---       I've seen fire and I've seen rain
<D>- <Bm>- <A>---       I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
<D>- <Bm>- <A>---       I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
<G>- <Em>- <A>---       But I always thought that I'd see you again
<A>---                  ....

[Verse]
<A>- <Em>- <D>- <A>-    Won't you look down upon me, Jesus, You've got to help me make a stand
<A>- <E>- <G>---        You've just got to see me through another day
<A>- <Em>- <D>- <A>-    My body's aching and my time is at hand
<A>- <E>- <G>---        And I won't make it any other way

[Chorus]
<D>- <Bm>- <A>---       I've seen fire and I've seen rain
<D>- <Bm>- <A>---       I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
<D>- <Bm>- <A>---       I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
<G>- <Em>- <A>---       But I always thought that I'd see you again
<A>---                  ....

[Verse]
<A>- <Em>- <D>- <A>-    Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
<A>- <E>- <G>---        Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
<A>- <Em>- <D>- <A>-    Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
<A>- <E>- <G>---        Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

[Chorus]
<D>- <Bm>- <A>---       Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
<D>- <Bm>- <A>---       I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
<D>- <Bm>- <A>---       I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
<G>- <Em>- <A>---       But I always thought that I'd see, baby, one more time again, now
<A>---                  ....

[Outro]
<G>- <Em>- <A>---       Thought I'd see you one more time again
<G>- <Em>- <A>---       There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
<G>- <Em>- <A>---       Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now . . .
