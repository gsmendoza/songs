- Verse: |-
    It's late in the evening
    She's wondering what clothes to wear
    She puts on her makeup
    And brushes her long blonde hair

- Chorus: |-
    And then she asks me
    "Do I look alright"
    And I say "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"

- Re-Intro: |

- Verse: |-
    We go to a party
    And everyone turns to see
    This beautiful lady
    That's walking around with me

- Chorus: |-
    And then she asks me
    "Do you feel alright"
    And I say: "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"

- Pre-Bridge: |
    ....

- Bridge: |-
    I feel wonderful because I see
    The love light in your eyes.
    And the wonder of it all
    Is that you just don't realize how much I love you.

- Verse: |-
    It's time to go home now
    And I've got an aching head
    So I give her the car keys
    And she helps me to bed

- Chorus: |-
    And then I tell her
    As I turn out the light
    I say "My darling you are wonderful tonight

- Tag: |-
    ....
    Oh my darling you were wonderful tonight."
