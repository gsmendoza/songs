  - Verse: |
      Wake up, Maggie, I think I got somethin'
      to say to you
      It's late September and I really should be
      back at school

  - Chorus: |
      I know I keep you amused
      But I feel I'm being used
      Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried
      anymore

      You led me away from home
      Just to save you from being alone
      You stole my heart and that's what really
      hurts

  - Verse: |
      The morning sun, when it's in your face
      Really shows your age
      But that don't worry me none. In my eyes,
      you're everything

  - Chorus: |
      I laughed at all of your jokes
      My love you didn't need to coax
      Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried
      anymore

      You led me away from home
      Just to save you from being alone
      You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do
      without

  - Verse: |
      All I needed was a friend to lend
      a guiding hand
      But you turned into a lover, and mother, what a lover
      You wore me out

  - Chorus: |
      All you did was wreck my bed
      And in the morning kick me in the head
      Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried
      anymore

      You led me away from home
      'Cause you didn't want to be alone
      You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you
      if I tried

  - Interlude: |
      .... ....

      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      I suppose I could collect my books
      And get on back to school
      Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of
      playing pool

  - Chorus: |
      Or find myself a rock and roll band
      That needs a helping hand
      Oh, Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your
      face

      You made a first-class fool out of me
      But I'm as blind as a fool can be
      You stole my heart, but I love you
      anyway
