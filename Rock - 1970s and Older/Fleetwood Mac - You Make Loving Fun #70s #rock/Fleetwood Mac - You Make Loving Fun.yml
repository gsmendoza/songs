  - Verse: |
      Sweet wonderful you
      You make me happy with the things you do
      Oh, can it be so?
      This feeling follows me wherever I go

  - Chorus: |
      I never did believe in miracles
      But I've a feeling it's time to try
      I never did believe in the ways of magic
      But I'm beginning to wonder why

  - Solo: |

  - Chorus
 
  - Verse: |
      Don't, don't break the spell
      It would be different and you know it will
      You, you make loving fun
      And I don't have to tell you but you're the only one

  - Outro: |
      You make loving fun (It's all I wanna do)
      You make loving fun (It's all I wanna do)
      You make loving fun (It's all I wanna do)
      You make loving fun (It's all I wanna do)

      .. .. .... (Fade)
