      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
      Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea
      You lay your bets and then you pay the price
      The things we do for love (The things we do for love)

  - Verse: |
      Communication is the problem to the answer
      You've got her number and your hand is on the phone
      The weather's turned and all the lines are down
      The things we do for love (The things we do for love)

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      Like walking in the rain and the snow
      When there's nowhere to go
      And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
      And you're looking for the answer in her eyes
      You think you're gonna break up
      Then she says she wants to make up

  - Chorus: |
      Ooh you made me love you
      Ooh you've got a way
      Ooh you had me crawling
      Up the wall

  - Solo: |

  - Verse (Last): |
      A compromise would surely help the situation
      Agree to disagree but disagree to part
      When after all it's just a compromise of
      The things we do for love (The things we do for love)

  - Outro (Fade): |
      The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
      The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
      The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
      The things we do for love (The things we do for love)

      The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
      The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
      The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
