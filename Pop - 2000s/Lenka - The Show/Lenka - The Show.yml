lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
      Life is a maze and love is a riddle
      I don't know where to go, can't do it alone,
      I've tried, and I don't know why

      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      Slow it down, make it stop
      Or else my heart is going to pop

      Cause it's too much, yeah it's a lot
      To be something I'm not

      I'm a fool out of love
      Cause I just can't get enough

      .... ....

  - Chorus: |
      I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
      Life is a maze and love is a riddle
      I don't know where to go, can't do it alone,
      I've tried, and I don't know why

      I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
      I'm so scared but I don't show it
      I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down,
      I know I've got to

      let it go, and just enjoy the show

  - Verse: |
      The sun is hot in the sky
      Just like a giant spot light

      The people follow the signs
      And synchronize in time

      It's a joke, nobody knows
      They've got a ticket to that show

      .... ....

  - Chorus 2: |
      Yeah, I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
      Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
      I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
      I've tried, and I don't know why

      I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
      I'm so scared but I don't show it
      I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down,
      I know I've got to

      let it go

  - Bridge: |
      And just enjoy the show
      Oh oh
      Just enjoy the show,
      Oh oh

  - Chorus: |
      I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
      Life is a maze and love is a riddle
      I don't know where to go, can't do it alone,
      I've tried, and I don't know why

      I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
      I'm so scared but I don't show it
      I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down
      I know I've got to

      let it go, and just enjoy the show

  - Outro: |
      Dum dee dum, da dum dee dum
      Just enjoy the show
      Dum dee dum, da dum dee dum
      Just enjoy the show

      I want my money back, I want my money back
      I want my money back, just enjoy the show
      I want my money back, I want my money back
      I want my money back, just enjoy the show

      ....
