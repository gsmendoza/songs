  - Verse A: |
      I found a love
        for me
      Darling, just dive right in
        and follow my lead

      Well, I found a girl,
        beautiful and sweet
      Oh, I never knew you were the someone
        waiting for me

  - Verse B: |
      'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love,
      Not knowing what it was
      I will not give you up
        this time

      But darling, just kiss me slow
      Your heart is all I own
      And in your eyes
        you're holding mine

  - Chorus: |
      Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
      With you between my arms

      Barefoot on the grass
      Listening to our favourite song

      When you said you looked a mess
      I whispered underneath my breath

      But you heard it,
      Darling, you look perfect tonight

  - Interlude: |

  - Verse A: |
      Well, I found a woman,
        stronger than anyone I know
      She shares my dreams, I hope that someday
        I'll share her home

      I found a love
        to carry more than just my secrets
      To carry love,
        to carry children of our own


  - Verse B: |
      We are still kids but we're so in love
      Fighting against all odds
      I know we'll be alright
        this time

      Darling, just hold my hand
      Be my girl, I'll be your man
      I see my future
        in your eyes


  - Chorus: |
      Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
      With you between my arms

      Barefoot on the grass
      Listening to our favourite song

      When I saw you in that dress
      Looking so beautiful

      I don't deserve this,
      Darling, you look perfect tonight

  - Chorus: |
      Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
      With you between my arms

      Barefoot on the grass
      Listening to our favourite song

      I have faith in what I see
      Now I know I have met

      An angel in person
      And she looks perfect

  - Outro: |
      I don't deserve this
      You look perfect tonight
