lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      I know I can't take one more
        step towards you
      'Cause all that's waiting is
        regret

      And don't you know I'm not your
        ghost anymore?
      You lost the love I love
        the most

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      I learned to live
        half-alive

      And now you want me
        one more time

  - Chorus A: |
      And who do you think you are
      Runnin' 'round leaving scars
      Collecting your jar of hearts
      And tearing love apart?

      You're gonna catch a cold
      From the ice inside your soul
      So don't come back for me
      Who do you think you are?

      ....

  - Verse: |
      I hear you're asking all
        around
      If I am anywhere
        to be found

      But I have grown
        too strong
      To ever fall back
        in your arms

  - Pre-Chorus

  - Chorus B: |
      And who do you think you are
      Runnin' 'round leaving scars
      Collecting your jar of hearts
      And tearing love apart?

      You're gonna catch a cold
      From the ice inside your soul
      So don't come back for me
      Who do you think you are?

      ....

  - Bridge: |
      Dear, it took so long
        just to feel alright

      Remember how to put
        back the light in my eyes

      I wish I had missed
        the first time that we kissed

      'Cause you broke all
        your promises

      And now you're back
        You don't get to get me back

  - Last Chorus: |
      And who do you think you are
      Runnin' 'round leaving scars
      Collecting your jar of hearts
      And tearing love apart?

      You're gonna catch a cold
      From the ice inside your soul
      So don't come back for me
      Who do you think you are?

      And who do you think you are
      Runnin' 'round leaving scars
      Collecting your jar of hearts
      And tearing love apart?

      You're gonna catch a cold
      From the ice inside your soul
      So don't come back for me
      Don't come back at all

      ....
