lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. ..
      ....

  - Verse: |
      Don't you notice how
      I get quiet when there's no one

      else around?
      Me and you and awkward silence

      Don't you dare look at
      me that way

      I don't need reminders of how
      you don't feel the same

  - Verse: |
      Oh, the burning pain
      Listening to you harp on 'bout some

      new soulmate
      "She's so perfect, " blah, blah, blah

      Oh, how I wish you'll wake
      up one day

      Run to me, confess your love,
      at least just let me say

  - Chorus: |
      That when I talk to you oh,
      Cupid walks right through

      And shoots an arrow
      through my heart

      And I sound like a loon,
      but don't you feel it too?

      Confess I loved you
      from the start

  - Solo: |
      .. ..
      ....

      .. ..
      ....

      .. ..
      .. ..

      ....
      ...!

  - Verse: |
      What's a girl to do?
      Lying on my bed, staring

      into the bluе
      Unrequited, terrifying

      Lovе is driving me
      a bit insane

      Have to get this off my chest
      I'm telling you today

  - Chorus

  - Outro: |
      Confess I loved you
      Just thinking of you

      I know I've loved you
      from the start
