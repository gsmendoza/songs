  - Verse: |
      Sometimes I get tired
      Of this me-first attitude
      You are the one thing that keeps me smiling
      That's why I'm always wishing hard for you

  - Verse: |
      Cause your light shines so bright
      I don't feel no solitude
      You are my first star at night
      I'd be lost in space without you

  - Chorus: |
      And I'll never
        lose my faith in you
      How will I ever
        get to heaven, if I do

  - Interlude A: |
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..

  - Verse: |
      Feels just so fine
      When we touch the sky me and you
      This is my idea of heaven
      Why can't it always be so good?

  - Verse: |
      But it's all right, I know you're out there
      Doing what you've gotta do
      You are my soul satellite
      I'd be lost in space without you

  - Interlude B: |

  - Coda: |
      I'll never lose my faith in you
      I'll never lose my faith in you
      I'll never lose my faith in you
      I'll never lose my faith in you

      I'll never lose my faith in you
      I'll never lose my faith in you
      I'll never lose my faith in you
      I'll never lose my faith in you

      I'll never lose my faith in you
      I'll never lose my faith in you
      I'll never lose my faith in you
      I'll never lose my faith in you

      I'll never lose my faith in you
      I'll never lose my faith in you
      I'll never lose my faith in you
      I'll never lose my faith in you (fade...)
