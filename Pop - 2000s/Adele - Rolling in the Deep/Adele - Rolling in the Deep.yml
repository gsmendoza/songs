lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      There's a fire starting in my heart
      Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
      Finally, I can see you crystal clear
      Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

  - Verse: |
      See how I'll leave with every piece of you
      Don't underestimate the things that I will do
      There's a fire starting in my heart
      Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      The scars of your love remind me of us
      They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
      The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
      I can't help feeling

  - Chorus: |
      We could've had it all
      Rolling in the deep
      You had my heart inside of your hand
      And you played it to the beat

  - Verse: |
      Baby, I have no story to be told
      But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
      Think of me in the depths of your despair
      Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      The scars of your love remind me of us
      They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
      The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
      I can't help feeling

  - Chorus: |
      We could've had it all
      Rolling in the deep
      You had my heart inside of your hand
      And you played it to the beat

  - Interlude: |
      Could've had it all
      Rolling in the deep
      You had my heart inside of your hand
      But you played it with a beating

  - Verse: |
      Throw your soul through every open door
      Count your blessings to find what you look for
      Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
      You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

  - Breakdown: |
      .... ....
      We could've had it all
      We could've had it all, yeah
      It all, it all, it all

  - Chorus: |
      We could've had it all
      Rolling in the deep
      You had my heart inside of your hand
      And you played it to the beat

  - Last Chorus: |
      Could've had it all
      Rolling in the deep
      You had my heart inside of your hand
      But you played it, you played it, you played it
      You played it to the beat
