[Intro]
<C>- <G>-          .. ..
<Dm>- <F>-         .. ..

<C>- <G>-          .. ..
<Dm>- <F>-         .. ..

[Verse]
<C>- <G>-          Put your lips close to mine
<Dm>- <F>-         As long as they don't touch

<C>- <G>-          Out of focus, eye to eye
<Dm>- <F>-         Til the gravity's too much

<C>- <G>-          And I'll do anything you say
<Dm>- <F>-         If you say it with your hands

<C>- <G>-          And I'd be smart to walk away
<Dm>- <F>-         But you're quicksand

[Chorus]
<C>- <G>-          This slope is treacherous
<Dm>- <F>-         This path is reckless

<C>- <G>-          This slope is treacherous
<Dm>- <F>-         And I I I like it

[Interlude]
<C>- <C>-          .. ..

[Verse]
<C>- <G>-          I can't decide if it's a choice
<Dm>- <F>-         Getting swept away

<C>- <G>-          I hear the sound of my own voice
<Dm>- <F>-         Asking you to stay

<C>- <G>-          And all we are is skin and bone
<Dm>- <F>-         Trained to get along

<C>- <G>-          Forever going with the flow
<Dm>- <F>-         But you're friction

[Chorus]
<C>- <G>-          This slope is treacherous
<Dm>- <F>-         This path is reckless

<C>- <G>-          This slope is treacherous
<Dm>- <F>-         And I I I like it

[Bridge 1]
<G>- <Am>-         Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
<F>---             And I will get you, get you alone

<G>- <Am>-         Your name has echoed through my mind
<F>---             And I just think you should, think you should know

<G>- <Am>-         That nothing safe is worth the drive
<F>---             And I would follow you, follow you home

<G>- <Am>-         I'll follow you, follow you home
<F>---             ....

[Chorus 3]
<C>- <G>-          This hope is treacherous
<Dm>- <F>-         This daydream is dangerous

<C>- <G>-          This hope is treacherous
<Dm>- <F>- <F>-    I I I, I I I, I I I

[Bridge 2]
<G>- <Am>-         Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
<F>---             And I will get you, get you alone

<G>- <Am>-         Your name has echoed through my mind
<F>---             And I just think you should, think you should know

<G>- <Am>-         That nothing safe is worth the drive
<F>---             And I would follow you, follow you home

<G>- <Am>-         I'll follow you, follow you home
<F>---             I'll follow you, follow you home

<G>- <Am>-         I'll follow you, follow you home
<F>---             ....

[Outro]
<C>- <G>-          This slope is treacherous
<Dm>- <F>...       I I I like it
