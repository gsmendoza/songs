lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. ..

      .. ..

  - Verse: |
      Put your lips close to mine
      As long as they don't touch

      Out of focus, eye to eye
      Til the gravity's too much

      And I'll do anything you say
      If you say it with your hands

      And I'd be smart to walk away
      But you're quicksand
 
  - Chorus: |
      This slope is treacherous
      This path is reckless

      This slope is treacherous
      And I I I like it
 
  - Interlude: |
      .. ..

  - Verse: |
      I can't decide if it's a choice
      Getting swept away

      I hear the sound of my own voice
      Asking you to stay

      And all we are is skin and bone
      Trained to get along

      Forever going with the flow
      But you're friction
 
  - Chorus

  - Bridge 1: |
      Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
      And I will get you, get you alone

      Your name has echoed through my mind
      And I just think you should, think you should know

      That nothing safe is worth the drive
      And I would follow you, follow you home

      I'll follow you, follow you home
      ....
 
  - Chorus 3: |
      This hope is treacherous
      This daydream is dangerous

      This hope is treacherous
      I I I, I I I, I I I
 

  - Bridge 2: |
      Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
      And I will get you, get you alone

      Your name has echoed through my mind
      And I just think you should, think you should know

      That nothing safe is worth the drive
      And I would follow you, follow you home

      I'll follow you, follow you home
      I'll follow you, follow you home

      I'll follow you, follow you home
      ....

      This slope is treacherous
