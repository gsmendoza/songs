lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. .. ... .
      .. .. .. ..
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      His laugh you'd die for, his laugh you'd die for
      The kind that colors the sky
      Heart intangible, slips away faster
      Than dandelion fluff in the sunlight

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      And he's got swirls of passion in his eyes
      Uncovering the dreams he dreams at night
      As much and hard as he tries to hide
      I can see right through,
      see right through

  - Verse: |
      His voice you'd melt for, he says my name like
      I'd fade away somehow if he's too loud
      What I would give for me to get my feet
      Back on the ground, head off the clouds

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      I laugh at how we're polar opposites
      I read him like a book and he's a clueless little kid
      Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space
      Just to make him smile,
      make him smile

  - Chorus A: |
      Oh, why can't we for once
      Say what we want, say what we feel?
      Oh, why can't you for once disregard the world
      and run to what you know is real?
      Take a chance with me,
      take a chance with me

  - Interlude: |
      Ooh
      Ooh
      Ooh
      Ooh

  - Verse: |
      His kiss you'd kill for, just one and you're done for
      Electricity surgin' in the air
      He drives me crazy, it's so beyond me
      How he'd look me dead in the eye and stay unaware

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      That I'm hopelessly captivated
      By a boy who thinks love's overrated
      How did I get myself in this arrangement?
      It baffles me too,
      baffles me too

  - Chorus B: |
      Oh, why can't we for once
      Say what we want, say what we feel?
      Oh, why can't you for once disregard the world
      and run to what you know is real?

  - Bridge: |
      In the end, we only regret
      The chances we didn't take
      I'll be your safety net
      So why not raise the stakes?

      I can hear your heart from across the room
      Pulsin' through my veins, I know you need this too
      Lie to me all you please
      I can see right through, see right through

  - Chorus B: |
      Oh, why can't we for once
      Say what we want, say what we feel?
      Oh, why can't you for once disregard the world
      and run to what you know is real?

  - Chorus A: |
      Oh, why can't we for once
      Say what we want, say what we feel?
      Oh, why can't you for once disregard the world
      and run to what you know is real?
      Take a chance with me
      Take a chance with me

  - Outro: |
      Ooh
      Ooh
      ....
