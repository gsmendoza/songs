  - Verse: |
      I've never known someone 
      like you
      Tangled in love, stuck by you 
      from the glue

  - Chorus: |
      Don't forget to kiss me
      or else you'll have to miss me
      I guess I'm stuck forever
      by the glue, oh, and you

  - Interlude 1: |
      .. ..

  - Verse: |
      Finding the right words
      To use for this song
      I have you in mind so
      It won't take so long

  - Chorus: |
      Never thought I'd find you
      But you're here and so I love you
      I'm not wrong when I say
      I've been stuck by the glue onto you

  - Interlude 2: |
      .. ..
      I've been stuck by glue
      .. ..
      Right onto you

      .. ..
      I've been stuck by glue
      .. ..
      .. ..

  - Outro: |
      I've never known
      .. ..
      I've never known
      someone like you

      I've never known
      .. ..
      I've never known
      someone like you

      ....
