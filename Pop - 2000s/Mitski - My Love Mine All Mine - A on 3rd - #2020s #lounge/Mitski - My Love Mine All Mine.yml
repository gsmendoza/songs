  - Verse: |
      Moon, a hole of light
      Through the big top tent up high
      Here before and after me
      Shinin' down on me

  - Verse: |
      Moon, tell me if I could
      Send up my heart to you?
      So, when I die, which I must do
      Could it shine down here with you?

  - Chorus 1: |
      'Cause my love is mine, all mine
      I love mine, mine, mine

      Nothing in the world belongs to me
      But my love mine, all mine, all mine

      ....

  - Interlude: |

  - Verse: |
      My baby, here on earth
      Showed me what my heart was worth
      So, when it comes to be my turn
      Could you shine it down here for her?

  - Chorus 2: |
      'Cause my love is mine, all mine
      I love mine, mine, mine

      Nothing in the world belongs to me
      But my love mine, all mine

      Nothing in the world is mine for free
      But my love mine, all mine, all mine

      ....

      ....
