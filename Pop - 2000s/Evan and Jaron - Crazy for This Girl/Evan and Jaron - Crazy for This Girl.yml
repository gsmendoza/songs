lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. ..
      .. ..

      .. ..
      .. ..

  - Verse: |
      She rolls the window down
      .. ..

      And she talks over the sound
      .. ..

      Of the cars that pass us by
      .. ..

      And I don't know why, but she's changed my mind
      .. ..

  - Chorus: |
      Would you look at her, she looks at me
      She's got me thinking about her constantly

      But she don't know how I feel
      ....

      And as she carries on without a doubt
      wonder if she's figured out

      I'm crazy for this girl
      ....

      Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl
      ....

  - Verse: |
      She was the one to hold me
      .. ..

      The night the sky fell down
      .. ..

      And what was I thinking when
      The world didn't end

      why didn't I know
      what I know now

  - Chorus: |
      Would you look at her, she looks at me
      She's got me thinking about her constantly

      But she don't know how I feel
      ....

      And as she carries on without a doubt
      I wonder if she's figured out

      I'm crazy for this girl
      ....

      Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl
      ....

  - Bridge: |
      Right now
      Face to face
      All my fears
      Pushed aside

      And right now
      I'm ready to spend the rest of
      My life
      With you

  - Chorus 3: |
      Would you look at her, She looks at me
      She's got me thinking about her constantly

      But she don't know how I feel
      ....

      And as she carries on without a doubt
      I wonder if she's figured out

      I'm crazy for this girl
      ....

      Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl
