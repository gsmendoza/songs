  - Verse: |
      Home grown alligator, see you later
      Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
      Something changed in the atmosphere, architecture unfamiliar
      I could get used to this

  - Verse: |
      Time flies by in the yellow and green
      Stick around and you'll see what I mean
      There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
      If you need me you know where I'll be

  - Chorus: |
      I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
      Feelin' like a someone
      I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
      Feelin' like a someone

  - Verse: |
      South of the Equator, navigator
      Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
      Deep sea divin' 'round the clock, bikini bottoms, lager tops
      I could get used to this

  - Verse: |
      Time flies by in the yellow and green
      Stick around and you'll see what I mean
      There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
      If you need me you know where I'll be

  - Chorus: |
      I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
      Feelin' like a someone
      I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
      Feelin' like a someone

  - Bridge: |
      We got two in the front, two in the back
      Sailin' along, and we don't look back
      (Back, back, back-back-back-back...)
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      Time flies by in the yellow and green
      Stick around and you'll see what I mean
      There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
      If you need me you know where I'll be

  - Chorus: |
      I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
      Feelin' like a someone
      I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
      Feelin' like a someone

  - Chorus: |
      I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
      Feelin' like a someone
      I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
      Feelin' like a someone, a someone, a someone, a someone...
