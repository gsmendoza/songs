  - Verse: |
      Well, I hear the train a comin', rolling ’round the bend
      I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
      ’Cause I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
      .... ....
      But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
      ....

  - Verse: |
      When I was just a baby, my mama told me, "Son
      Always be a good boy, don't never play with guns", yeah
      They said I shot a man down in Reno, but that was just a lie
      .... ....
      When I hear the whistle blowing, I just hang my head and cry
      (Now listen to the guitar go)

  - Verse: |
      I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy car
      They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
      But I didn’t hurt nobody, I should be rollin’ free, free
      .... ....
      But those people keep on movin' and that’s what tortured me
      ....

  - Verse: |
      Well, if they freed me from this prison and the railroad train was mine
      I bet I'd move it on just a little farther down the line
      Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
      .... ....
      And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
      ....
