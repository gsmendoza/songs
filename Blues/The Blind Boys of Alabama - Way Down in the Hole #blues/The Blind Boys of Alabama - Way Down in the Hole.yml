  - Verse: |
      When you walk through the garden
      You gotta watch your back
      Well I beg your pardon
      Walk the straight and narrow track

      If you walk with Jesus
      He's gonna save your soul
      You gotta keep the devil
      Way down in the hole

  - Verse: |
      He's got the fire and the fury
      At his command
      Well you don't have to worry
      If you hold on to Jesus' hand

      We'll all be safe from Satan
      When the thunder rolls
      Just gotta help me keep the devil
      Way down in the hole

  - Verse: |
      All the angels sing
      'Bout Jesus' mighty sword
      And they'll shield you with their wings
      And keep you close to the Lord

      Don't pay heed to temptation
      For his hands are so cold
      You gotta help me keep the devil
      Way down in the hole
