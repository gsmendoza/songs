John Denver - This Old Guitar

Verse
This old guitar taught me to sing a love song            I- V- vi- iii-
It showed me how to laugh and how to cry                 IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
It introduced me to some friends of mine and             IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
brightened up some days
It helped me make it through some lonely nights          IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
Oh what a friend to have on a cold and lonely night      IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
-                                                        IV- V-

Verse
This old guitar gave me my lovely lady                   I- V- vi- iii-
It opened up her eyes and ears to me                     IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
It brought us close together and I guess it broke her    IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
heart
It opened up the space for us to be                      IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
What a lovely place and a lovely space to be             IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V

Verse
This old guitar gave me my life my living                I- V- vi- iii-
All the things you know I love to do                     IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
To serenade the stars that shine from a sunny            IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
mountainside
Most of all to sing my songs for you                     IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
I love to sing my songs for you, yes I do you know       IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
I love to sing my songs for you                          IV- V-
