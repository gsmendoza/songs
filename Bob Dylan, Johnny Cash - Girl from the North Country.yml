lyrics:
  - Chorus: |
      If youâ€™re travelin' in the north country fair
      Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
      [Remember me|Please say hello] to the one who lives there
      For she once was a true love of mine

  - Verse: |
      See for me that her hair's hangin' down
      It curls and falls all down her breast
      See for me that her hair's hangin' down
      That's the way I remember her best

  - Verse: |
      If you go when the snowflakes fall
      When the rivers freeze and summer ends
      Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm
      To keep her from the howling winds

  - Chorus
