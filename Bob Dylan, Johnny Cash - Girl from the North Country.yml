lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      ...
      ...

  - Chorus: |
      If you’re travelin' in the north country fair
      Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
      [Remember me|Please say hello] to the one who lives there
      For she once was a true love of mine

  - Verse: |
      See for me that her hair's hangin' down
      It curls and falls all down her breast
      See for me that her hair's hangin' down
      That's the way I remember her best

  - Verse: |
      If you go when the snowflakes fall
      When the rivers freeze and summer ends
      Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm
      To keep her from the howling winds

  - Chorus

  - Interlude: |

  - Chorus 2: |
      If you’re travelin' in the north country fair
      Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
      [Remember me|Please say hello] to the one who lives there
      (Pause) For she once was a true love of mine

  - Outro: |
      A true love of mine 2x
      A true love of mine 4x
      For she once was a true love of mine
