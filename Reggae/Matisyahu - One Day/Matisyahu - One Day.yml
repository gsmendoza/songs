  - Verse: |
      Sometimes I lay under the moon
      I thank God I'm breathing
      And I pray don't take me soon
      Cause I am here for reason
 
  - Pre-Chorus: |
      Sometimes in my tears I drown
      But I never let it get me down
      So when negativity surrounds
      I know some day it'll all turn around because
 
  - Chorus: |
      All my life I've been waiting for
      I've been praying for, for the people to say
      That we don't wanna fight no more
      They'll be no more war and our children will play

      One day, one day
      One day
      One day, one day
      One day

  - Verse 2: |
      It's not about win or lose
      We all lose when they feed on the
      Souls of the innocent, blood drenched pavement
      Keep on moving though the waters stay raging

      In this maze you can lose your ways
      Your way
      It might drive you crazy but don't let it faze you
      No way no way
 
  - Pre-Chorus

  - Chorus
 
  - Break: |
      One day this all will change, treat people the same
      Stop with the violence, down with the hate
      One day we'll all be free and proud to be
      Under the same sun singing songs of freedom like
