lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
      The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head.
      The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
      The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

  - Verse: |
      The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
      But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
      I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
      And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh.

  - Verse: |
      Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay
      Close by me forever, and love me, I pray
      Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
      And take us to heaven, to live with Thee there.
