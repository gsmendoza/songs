James Taylor - Fire and Rain

Key of C (Capo on 3rd)

[Intro]
...                                                         <A>- <G>- <D>- <A>-
...                                                         <A>- <E>- <G>---

[Verse]
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone       <A>- <Em>- <D>- <A>-
Susanne the plans they made put an end to you               <A>- <E>- <G>---
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song        <A>- <Em>- <D>- <A>-
I just can't remember who to send it to                     <A>- <E>- <G>---

[Chorus]
I've seen fire and I've seen rain                           <D>- <Bm>- <A>---
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end         <D>- <Bm>- <A>---
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend       <D>- <Bm>- <A>---
But I always thought that I'd see you again                 <G>- <Em>- <A>---

[Verse]
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus, You've got to help      <A>- <Em>- <D>- <A>-
me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day               <A>- <E>- <G>---
My body's aching and my time is at hand                     <A>- <Em>- <D>- <A>-
And I won't make it any other way                           <A>- <E>- <G>---

[Chorus]
I've seen fire and I've seen rain                           <D>- <Bm>- <A>---
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end         <D>- <Bm>- <A>---
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend       <D>- <Bm>- <A>---
But I always thought that I'd see you again                 <G>- <Em>- <A>---

[Verse]
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned        <A>- <Em>- <D>- <A>-
towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head    <A>- <E>- <G>---
around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to        <A>- <Em>- <D>- <A>-
talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground    <A>- <E>- <G>---

[Chorus]
I've seen fire and I've seen rain                           <D>- <Bm>- <A>---
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end         <D>- <Bm>- <A>---
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend       <D>- <Bm>- <A>---
But I always thought that I'd see you again                 <G>- <Em>- <A>---

[Outro]
Thought I'd see you one more time again                     <G>- <Em>- <A>---
There's just a few things coming my way this time           <G>- <Em>- <A>---
around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain,     <G>- <Em>- <A>---
now . . .
