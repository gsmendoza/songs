  - Verse: |
      When we were younger we thought
      Everyone was on our side
      Then we grew a little
      And romanticized

      The time I saw
      Flowers in your hair
      ....
      ....

      Cause it takes a boy to live
      Takes a man to pretend he was there
      ....
      ....

  - Verse: |
      So then we grew a little
      and knew a lot
      And now we demonstrated
      it to the cops

      And all the things we said
      We were self-assured
      ....
      ....

      Cause it's a long road to wisdom
      But it's a short one to being ignored
      ....
      ....

  - Chorus 1: |
      Be in my eyes
      ....
      Be in my heart
      ....

      Be in my eyes
      Ai yai yai
      Be in my heart
      ....

  - Verse: |
      So now I think that I could
      Love you back
      And I hope it's not too late cause
      You're so attractive

      And the way you move
      I won't close my eyes
      ....
      ....

      Cause it takes a man to live
      But it takes a woman to make him compromise
      ....
      ....

  - Chorus 2: |
      Be in my eyes
      ....
      Be in my heart
      ....

      Be in my eyes
      Ai yai yai
      Be in my heart
      ....
