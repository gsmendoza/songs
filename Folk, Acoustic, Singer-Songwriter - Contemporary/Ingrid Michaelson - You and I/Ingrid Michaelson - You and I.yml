  - Verse: |
      Don't you worry, there my honey
      We might not have any money
      But we've got our love to pay the bills
      ...

      Maybe I think you're cute and funny,
      Maybe I wanna do what bunnies
      Do with you, if you know what I mean
      ...

  - Chorus: |
      Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents
      Homes in the South of France

      Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
      And teach them how to dance

      Let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
      Making everybody look like ants

      From way up there, you and I, you and I
      ....

  - Verse: |
      Well you might be a bit confused
      And you might be a little bit bruised
      But baby how we spoon like no one else
      ....

      So I will help you read those books
      If you will soothe my worried looks
      And we will put the lonesome on the shelf
      ....
