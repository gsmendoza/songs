Ingrid Michaelson - You and I


[Intro]
<C>---          ....
<C>---          ....

[Verse]
<C>---          Don't you worry, there my honey
<F>---          We might not have any money
<Am>---         But we've got our love to pay the bills
<F>---          ...

<C>---          Maybe I think you're cute and funny,
<F>---          Maybe I wanna do what bunnies
<Am>---         Do with you, if you know what I mean
<F>---          ...

[Chorus]
<C>- <E>-       Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents
<F>- <C>-       Homes in the South of France

<C>- <E>-       Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
<F>- <G>-       And teach them how to dance

<C>- <E>-       Let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
<F>- <D>-       Making everybody look like ants

<C>- <F> <G>    From way up there, you and I, you and I
<C>---          ....

[Verse]
<C>---          Well you might be a bit confused
<F>---          And you might be a little bit bruised
<Am>---         But baby how we spoon like no one else
<F>---          ....

<C>---          So I will help you read those books
<F>---          If you will soothe my worried looks
<Am>---         And we will put the lonesome on the shelf
<F>---          ....

[Chorus]
<C>- <E>-       Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents
<F>- <C>-       Homes in the South of France

<C>- <E>-       Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
<F>- <G>-       And teach them how to dance

<C>- <E>-       Let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
<F>- <D>-       Making everybody look like ants

<C>- <F> <G>    From way up there, you and I, you and I
<C>---          ....

[Chorus]
<C>- <E>-       Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents
<F>- <C>-       Homes in the South of France

<C>- <E>-       Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
<F>- <G>-       And teach them how to dance

<C>- <E>-       Let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
<F>- <D>-       Making everybody look like ants

<C>- <F> <G>    From way up there, you and I, you and I
<C>---          ....
