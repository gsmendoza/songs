lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      At least you know
      You were taken by a pro

      I know just how
      you feel

      She talked a perfect game
      Deflecting all the blame

      You took the jack and changed the flat
      And got behind the wheel, now you're

  - Chorus: |
      Driving sideways
      Taken in by the scenery

      As you're propelled
      along

      And your companion
      Will not help you to navigate

      For fear she may
      be wrong

      For fear she may
      be wrong

  - Verse: |
      And you will say
      That you're making headway

      And put it in
      overdrive

      But you're mistaking speed
      For getting what you need

      And never even noticing
      You never do arrive, 'cause you're

  - Chorus: |
      Driving sideways
      If you roll down the window you'll see

      You're where you don't
      belong

      And your companion
      Will not help you to navigate

      For fear she may
      be wrong

      For fear she may
      be wrong

  - Bridge: |
      And you're powered by
      The hopeful lie

      That it's just around
      the bend

      And when this, by default
      Comes screeching to a halt

      Let's hope that you know what to do
      To start it up again

  - Chorus (Last): |
      Driving sideways
      Hitting scan on the radio

      So she can sing
      along

      And she'll sit
      Thinking you're going to handle it

      Until she's proven
      wrong

      Until she's proven
      wrong

      Until you prove
      her wrong
      (driving sideways)
