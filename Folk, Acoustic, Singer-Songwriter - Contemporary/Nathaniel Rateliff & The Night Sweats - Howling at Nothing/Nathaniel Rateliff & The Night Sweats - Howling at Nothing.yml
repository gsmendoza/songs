  - Verse: |
      Some are waving it around
      Someone carried me home
      One was never noticed sleeping on the floor
      But I know we were there

  - Verse: |
      Some were playing in a round
      Some were dipping so low
      It never seemed to matter as the night slipped away
      'Cause there was soul in the air

  - Chorus: |
      We were howlin at the moon
      We were shaking our hips
      Danced until we flat out falling into bed
      But I won't let you go

  - Verse: |
      So, let me in or let me down
      Let me lay here so slow
      Baby just keep holding got to move our feet
      'Cause you know it ain't end

  - Verse: |
      Step it in or step it out
      Cut it all in and run
      Kept on till it mattered baby I don't even see
      But I know we were there

  - Chorus: |
      We were howling at the moon
      We were shaking our hips
      Danced until we flat out falling into bed
      Said I won't let you go

  - Chorus: |
      We were howling at the moon
      We were shaking our hips
      Danced until we flat out falling into bed

  - Tag: |
      Danced until we flat out falling into bed
      Said I won't let you go
