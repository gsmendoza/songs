lyrics: 
  - Intro: |
      .... .... .... ....

  - Chorus: |
      Today I started loving you again
      And I'm right back where I've really always been
      I got all over you just long enough to 
        let my heartache mend
      And then today I started loving you again

  - Verse: |
      What a fool I was to think I could get by
      With only these few million tears I've cried
      I should have known the worst was yet to come
      And that cryin' time for me had just begun

  - Last Chorus: |
      Today I started loving you again
      And I'm right back where I've really always been
      I got all over you just long enough to
        let my heartache mend
      And then today I started loving you again
      Yes then today I started loving you again
