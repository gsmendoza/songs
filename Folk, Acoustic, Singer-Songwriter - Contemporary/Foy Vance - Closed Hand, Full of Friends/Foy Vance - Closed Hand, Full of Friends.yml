lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .... .... .... ....

  - Verse 1: |
      The scenery's changing and it warms my soul
      I'm 200 miles down and a long way yet to go
      So, get your boots on and your walking cool
      And we'll together leave our footprints upon a virgin snow

  - Verse 2: |
      That ancient sunrise will soon descend
      And we'll be left here pondering on the things which you cannot change
      So, let's start over with no means to an end
      Just in love and out of hope and a closed hand, full of friends

  - Pre-chorus: |
      . . . . ....
      . . . .

  - Chorus 1: |
      Yeah, well, livin' was alright, but I was dead in the water
      Couldn't see it in its light, I couldn't kneel in its altar
      All I wanted was to tear it right down to the ground

      But I'm feeling alright now,
      yeah, I'm feeling alright

  - Post-chorus: |
      .... .... .... ....

  - Verse 3: |
      Every morning when the coffee's on
      And I rediscover that color in your eyes, in its gold and its bronze
      And in the moonlight go get the camera, just go
      With the recitations of the parish poets popping on our scrolls

  - Pre-chorus: |
      . . . . ....
      . . . .

  - Chorus 2: |
      Yeah, well, I was alright but I was dead in the water
      Could see it's light, I couldn't kneel in its altar
      All I wanted was a turn right down to the promising

      Through this fleeting culture
      And hide away from wolves and the vultures
      All they wanted was to tear me right down to the ground

      Oh, I'm feeling alright, I am now,
      yeah, I'm feeling alright

  - Post-chorus: |
      .... .... .... ....

  - Pre-bridge:
      .... ....

  - Bridge 1: |
      In the recitations of the parish poets
      In the buildings, in the burrows, in the locked boats
      I will find my means to an end
      With an open heart in hold and a closed hand, full of friends

  - Bridge 2: |
      In the recitations of the parish poets
      In the buildings, in the burrows, in the lochte boats
      I will find my means to an end
      With an open heart in hold and a closed hand, full of friends

  - Bridge 3: |
      In the recitations of the parish poets
      In the buildings, in the burrows, in the locked boats
      I will find my means to an end
      With an open heart in hold and a closed hand, full of friends

  - Bridge 4: |
      In the recitations of the parish poets
      In the buildings, in the burrows, in the locked boats
      I will find my means to an end
      With an open heart in hold and a closed hand, full of friends
