  - Verse: |
      All that I have is a river
      The river is always my home
      Lord, take me away
      For I just cannot stay
      Or I'll sink in my skin and my bones

  - Chorus: |
      The water sustains me without even trying
      The water can't drown me, I'm done
      With my dying

  - Interlude: |
      ... ... ... ...

  - Verse: |
      Please help me build a small boat
      One that'll ride on the flow
      Where the river runs deep
      And the larger fish creep
      I'm glad of what keeps me afloat

  - Chorus: |
      The water sustains me without even trying
      The water can't drown me, I'm done
      With my dying

  - Interlude: |
      ... ... ... ...

  - Verse: |
      Now deeper the water I sail
      And faster the current I'm in
      That each night brings the stars
      And the song in my heart
      Is a tune for the journeyman's tale

  - Chorus: |
      The water sustains me without even trying
      The water can't drown me, I'm done
      With my dying

  - Bridge: |
      Now the land that I knew is a dream
      And the line on the distance grows faint
      So wide is my river
      The horizon a sliver
      The artist has run out of paint
      ... ...

  - Verse: |
      Where the blue of the sea meets the sky
      And the big yellow sun leads me home
      I'm everywhere now
      The way is a vow
      To the wind of each breath by and by

  - Chorus: |
      The water sustains me without even trying
      The water can't drown me, I'm done
      With my dying
