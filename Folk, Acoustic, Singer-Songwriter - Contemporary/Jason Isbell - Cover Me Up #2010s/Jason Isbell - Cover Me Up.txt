[Intro]
<D>- <G>-        .. ..
<D>---           ....

[Verse]
<D>- <G>-        A heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun
<D>---             It can't trust anyone
<D>- <G>-        I was so sure what I needed was more
<D>---             Tried to shoot out the sun
<Bm>- <G>-       Days when we raged, we flew off the page
<D>---             Such damage was done
<D>- <G>-        But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
<D>---             I was meant for someone

[Chorus]
<D>- <G>-        So, girl, leave your boots by the bed,
<D>---             we ain't leavin' this room
<D>- <G>-        'Til someone needs medical help
<D>---             or the magnolias bloom
<Em>- <G>-       It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out
<Bm>---            to chop wood
<D>- <G>-        So cover me up and know you're enough
<D>---             to use me for good

[Interlude]
<D>- <G>-        .. ..
<D>---           ....

[Verse]
<D>- <G>-        Put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
<D>---             In Richmond on high
<D>- <G>-        But I sobered up and I swore off that stuff
<D>---             Forever this time
<Bm>- <G>-       And the old lover's sing, "I thought it'd be me
<D>---             Who helped him get home"
<D>- <G>-        But home was a dream, one I'd never seen
<D>---             'Til you came along

[Chorus]
<D>- <G>-        So girl, hang your dress up to dry,
<D>---             we ain't leavin' this room
<D>- <G>-        'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide
<D>---             and the river runs through
<Em>- <G>-       And carries this house on the stones
<Bm>---            like a piece of driftwood
<D>- <G>-        Cover me up and know you're enough
<D>---             to use me for good

[Solo]
<D>- <G>-        .. ..
<D>---           ....
<D>- <G>-        .. ..
<D>---           ....

[Last Chorus]
<D>- <G>-        So girl, leave your boots by the bed,
<D>---             we ain't leavin' this room
<D>- <G>-        'Til someone needs medical help
<D>---             or the magnolias bloom
<Em>- <G>-       It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out
<Bm>---            to chop wood
<D>- <G>-        So cover me up and know you're enough
<D>---             to use me for good
<D>- <G>-        Cover me up and know you're enough
<D>---             to use me for good
<D>- <G>-        .. ..
<D>...           ....
