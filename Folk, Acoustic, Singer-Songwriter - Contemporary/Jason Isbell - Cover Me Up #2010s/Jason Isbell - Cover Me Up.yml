  - Intro: |

  - Verse: |
      A heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun
        It can't trust anyone
      I was so sure what I needed was more
        Tried to shoot out the sun
      Days when we raged, we flew off the page
        Such damage was done
      But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
        I was meant for someone

  - Chorus: |
      So, girl, leave your boots by the bed,
        we ain't leavin' this room
      'Til someone needs medical help
        or the magnolias bloom
      It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out
        to chop wood
      So cover me up and know you're enough
        to use me for good

  - Interlude: |
      .. ..
      ....

  - Verse: |
      Put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
        In Richmond on high
      But I sobered up and I swore off that stuff
        Forever this time
      And the old lover's sing, "I thought it'd be me
        Who helped him get home"
      But home was a dream, one I'd never seen
        'Til you came along

  - Chorus: |
      So girl, hang your dress up to dry,
        we ain't leavin' this room
      'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide
        and the river runs through
      And carries this house on the stones
        like a piece of driftwood
      Cover me up and know you're enough
        to use me for good

  - Solo: |

  - Last Chorus: |
      So girl, leave your boots by the bed,
        we ain't leavin' this room
      'Til someone needs medical help
        or the magnolias bloom
      It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out
        to chop wood
      So cover me up and know you're enough
        to use me for good
      Cover me up and know you're enough
        to use me for good
      .. ..
