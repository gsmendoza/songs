lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..

  - Verse: |
      I am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves
      I keep my lamp lit, to warn the sailors on their way
      I'll tell a story, paint you a picture from my past
      I was so happy, but joy in this life seldom lasts

  - Interlude: |
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..

  - Verse: |
      I had a keeper, he helped me warn the ships at sea
      We had grown closer, 'till his joy meant everything to me
      And he was to marry, a girl who shone with beauty and light
      And they loved each other and with me watched the sunsets into night

  - Chorus: |
      And the waves crashing around me,
      the sand slips out to the sea
      And the winds that blow remind me
      Of what has been, and what can never be
      .. ..

  - Interlude: |
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..

  - Verse 2: |
      She'd had to leave us, my keeper he prayed for a safe return
      But when the night came, the weather to a raging storm had turned
      He watched her ship fight but in vain against the wild and terrible wind
      In me so helpless, as dashed against the rock she met her end

  - Chorus

  - Interlude 2: |
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..

  - Verse: |
      Then on the next day, my keeper found her washed up on the shore
      He kissed her cold face that they'd be together soon he swore
      I saw him crying, watched as he buried her in the sand
      And then he climbed my tower, and off the edge of me he ran

  - Chorus

  - Interlude 3: |
      .. .. .. ..

  - Outro: |
      I am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves
      And though I'm empty, I still warn the sailors on their way
