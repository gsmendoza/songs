lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..

  - Verse 1: |
      I cannot say that I know you well
      .. .. ..

      But you can't lie to me with all these books that you sell
      .. ..

      I'm not trying to follow you to the end of the world
      .. .. ..

      I'm just trying to leave something behind
      .. .. ..

  - Verse 2: |
      Words have come from men and mouse
      .. .. ..

      Oh, but I can't help thinking that I have heard the wrong crowd
      .. ..

      When all the water is gone my job will be too
      .. .. ..

      So I'm trying to leave something behind
      ..

  - Chorus 1: |
      Oh, money is free but love costs more than our bread
      ..

      And the ceiling is hard to reach
      ..

      Oh, the future ahead is broken and red
      .. .. ..

      And I'm trying to leave something behind
      .. .. .. .. ..

  - Verse 3: |
      This whole world is a foreign land
      ..

      We swallow the moon, but we do not know our own hand
      ..

      Oh, we're running with the case, but we ain't got the gold
      ..

      Yet we're trying to leave something behind
      .. .. ..

  - Verse 4: |
      My friends, I belive we are at the wrong fight
      ..

      And I can not read what I did not write
      ..

      I've been to his house, but the master is gone
      .. .. ..

      Yet we're trying to leave something behind
      .. .. ..

  - Verse 5: |
      Now there is a beast who has taken my brain
      ..

      You can put me to bed, but you can't feel my pain
      ..

      When the machine has taken the soul from the man
      .. .. ..

      It's time to leave something behind
      ..

  - Chorus 2: |
      Oh, money is free but love costs more than our bread
      ..

      And the ceiling is hard to reach
      ..

      Oh, the future ahead is already dead
      .. .. ..

      And it's time to leave something behind
      .. .. .. .. ..

  - Verse 6: |
      Now, I've got this feeling that I'm still at the shore
      .. .. ..

      And pockets don't know what it means to be poor
      ..

      I can get through the wall if you give me a door
      ..

      So I can leave something behind
      ..

  - Verse 7: |
      Oh, wisdom is lost in the trees somewhere
      ..

      Oh, you're not gonna find it in some mental gray hair
      ..

      It's locked up from those who hurry ahead
      ..

      And it's time to leave something behind
      ..

  - Chorus 3: |
      Oh, money is free but love costs more than our bread
      ..

      And the ceiling is hard to reach
      ..

      When my son is a man, he will know what I meant
      .. .. ..

      When I was just trying to leave something behind
      .. .. ..

      And I'm trying to leave something behind
