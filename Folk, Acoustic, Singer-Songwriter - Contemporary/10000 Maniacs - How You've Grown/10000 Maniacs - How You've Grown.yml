lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. ....
      .. .. ....

  - Verse 1: |
      "My, how you've grown."
      I remember that phrase from my childhood days too.
      "Just wait and see."
      I remember those words and how they chided me,
      when patient was the hardest thing to be.

  - Refrain: |
      Because we can't make up for the time that we've lost,
      I must let these memories provide.
      .. ....
      No little girl can stop her world to wait for me.

  - Verse 2: |
      I should have known.
      At your age, in a string of days the year is gone.
      But in that space of time, it takes so long.

  - Refrain: |
      Because we can't make up for the time that we've lost,
      I must let these memories provide.
      .. ....
      No little girl can stop her world to wait for me.

  - Chorus: |
      Every time we say goodbye you're frozen in my mind
      as the child that you never will be,
      you never will be again.

  - Solo to Refrain: |
      .... ....
      .. .. ....

      .... .. ..
      .... I'll never be
      .. ....
      more to you than a stranger could be.

  - Chorus: |
      Every time we say goodbye you're frozen in my mind
      as the child that you never will be,
      you never will be again.

  - Chorus (last): |
      Every time we say goodbye you're frozen in my mind
      as the child that you never will be,
      will be again.
