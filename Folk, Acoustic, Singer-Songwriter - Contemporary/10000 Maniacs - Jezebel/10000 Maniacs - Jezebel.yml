lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. ..
      .. ..
      ....

  - Verse: |
      To think of my task is chilling.
      To know I was carefully building
      the mask I was wearing
      for two years, swearing
      I'd tear it off.

  - Verse: |
      I've sat in the dark explaining
      to myself that I'm straining
      too hard for feelings
      I ought to find
      easily.

  - Pre-chorus: |
      Called myself Jezebel.
      I don't believe.

  - Chorus 1: |
      Before I say that the vows we made
      weigh like a stone in my heart.
      Family is family,
      don't let this tear us apart.

  - Verse: |
      You lie there, an innocent baby.
      I feel like the thief who is raiding
      your home,
      entering and breaking and taking
      in every room.

  - Verse: |
      I know your feelings are tender
      and that inside you the embers still glow.
      But I'm a shadow,
      I'm only a bed
      of blackened coal.

  - Pre-chorus: |
      Call myself Jezebel
      for wanting to leave.

  - Chorus 2: |
      I'm not saying I'm replacing
      love for some other word
      to describe the sacred tie
      that bound me to you.

      I'm just saying we've mistaken
      one for thousands of words.
      And for that mistake, I've caused you such pain
      that I damn that word.

  - Bridge: |
      I've no more ways to hide
      ..
      that I'm a desolate and empty,
      hollow place inside.

      .. ..
      .. ..

  - Chorus 3: |
      I'm not saying I'm replacing
      love for some other word
      to describe the sacred tie
      that bound me to you.

      I'm not saying love's a plaything.
      No, it's a powerful word,
      inspired by strong desire
      to bind myself to you.

      How I wish that we never
      had tried
      to be man and his wife, to weave our lives
      into a blindfold over both our eyes.
