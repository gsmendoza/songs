  - Verse: |
      I had a dream last night
      I dream't that I was swimming
      And the stars up above
      Directionless and drifting

      Somewhere in the dark
      Were the sirens and the thunder
      And around me as I swam
      The drifters who'd gone under

  - Chorus: |
      Time, love
      Time, love
      Time, love
      ....

      Time, love
      Time, love
      Time, love
      It's only a change of time

  - Interlude 1: |

  - Verse: |
      I had a dream last night
      And rusting far below me
      Battered hulls and broken hardships
      Leviathan and Lonely

      I was thirsty so I drank
      And though it was salt water
      There was something 'bout the way
      It tasted so familiar

  - Chorus: |
      Time, love
      Time, love
      Time, love
      ....

      Time, love
      Time, love
      Time, love
      It's only a change of time

  - Bridge: |
      The black clouds I'm hanging
      This anchor I'm dragging
      The sails of memory
      Rip open in silence

      We cut through the lowlands
      All hands through the salt lands
      The white caps of memory
      Confusing and violent

  - Verse: |
      I had a dream last night
      And when I opened my eyes
      Your shoulder blade, your spine
      Were shorelines in the moon light

      New worlds for the weary
      New lands for the living
      I could make it if I tried
      I closed my eyes I kept on swimming

  - Chorus: |
      Time, love
      Time, love
      Time, love
      It's only a change of time

      Time, love
      Time, love
      Time, love
      It's only a change of time

  - Chorus: |
      Time, love
      Time, love
      Time, love
      It's only a change of time

      Time, love
      Time...
      Time, love
      It's only a change of time

  - Last Chorus: |
      Time, love
      Time, love
      Time, love
      It's only a change of time

      Time, love
      Time, love
      Time, love
      It's only a change of time
