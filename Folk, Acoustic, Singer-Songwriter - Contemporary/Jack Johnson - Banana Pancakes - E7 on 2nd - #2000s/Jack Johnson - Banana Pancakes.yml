lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .... ....
      .... ....

      Well, can't you see that it's just raining?
      There ain’t no need to go outside.

      But baby,

  - Verse: |
      You hardly even notice
      When I try to show you this
      Song, it's meant to keep you
      From doing what you're supposed to

      Like waking up too early
      Maybe we could sleep in
      I'll make you banana pancakes
      Pretend like it's the weekend

  - Chorus: |
      now.
      And we could pretend it all the time.

      Can't you see that it's just raining?
      There ain't no need to go outside.

      But just maybe,

  - Verse: |
      Hala ka ukulele
      Mama made a baby
      I really don’t mind the practice
      'Cause you're my little lady

      Lady, lady love me
      'Cause I love to lay here lazy
      We could close the curtains
      Pretend like there's no world

  - Chorus 2: |
      outside.
      And we could pretend it all the time.

      And can't you see that it's just raining?
      There ain’t no need to go outside.

      Ain’t no need, ain’t no need.
      Mm-mmm-mm-mmm.

      Can't you see, can't you see?
      Rain all day and I don't mind.

      ....

  - Bridge: |
      But the telephone singing, ringing, it's too early, don't pick it up
      We don't need to. We got everything
      we need right here and everything we need is enough
      Just so easy when the

      whole world fits inside of your arms
      Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?
      Wake up slow, mm-mmm,
      wake up slow. But baby

  - Verse: |
      You hardly even notice
      When I try to show you this
      Song, it's meant to keep you
      From doing what you're supposed to

      Like waking up too early
      Maybe we could sleep in
      I'll make you banana pancakes
      Pretend like it's the weekend

  - Last Chorus: |
      now.
      And we could pretend it all the time.

      Can't you see that it's just raining?
      There ain't no need to go outside.

      Ain't no need, ain't no need.
      Rain all day and I really really really don't mind.

      Can't you see, can't you see?
      We've got to wake up slow...
