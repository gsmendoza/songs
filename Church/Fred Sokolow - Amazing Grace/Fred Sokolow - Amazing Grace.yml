lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
      That saved a wretch like me.
      I once was lost, but now I’m found,
      Was blind but now I see.

  - Verse: |
      ’Twas grace that taught my eyes to see
      And grace my fears relieved.
      How wondrous did that grace appear,
      The hour I first believed.

  - Verse: |
      When we’ve been here ten thousand years,
      Bright shining as the sun,
      We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
      Than when we first begun.
