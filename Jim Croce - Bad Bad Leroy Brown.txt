Jim Croce - Bad Bad Leroy Brown


[Intro]
...                                                <G>--- <G>- <D7>-

[Verse]
Well the South side of Chicago                     <G>---
is the baddest part of town                        <Am>---
And if you go down there you better just beware    <B7>- <C>-
Of a man named Leroy Brown                         <D> <C> <G> <D7>

[Verse]
Now Leroy more than trouble                        <G>---
you see he stand about six foot four               <Am>---
All the downtown ladies call him treetop lover     <B7>- <C>-
All the men just call him sir                      <D> <C> <G> <D7>

[Chorus]
And he bad, bad Leroy Brown                        <G>---
The baddest man in the whole damned town           <Am>---
Badder than old King Kong                          <B7>- <C>-
And meaner than a junkyard dog                     <D> <C> <G> <D7>

[Verse]
Now Leroy, he a gambler                            <G>---
and he like his fancy clothes                      <Am>---
And he like to wave his diamond rings              <B7>- <C>-
in front of everybody's nose                       <D> <C> <G> <D7>

[Verse]
He got a custom Continental,                       <G>---
he got an Eldorado too                             <Am>---
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun,             <B7>- <C>-
he got a razor in his shoe                         <D> <C> <G> <D7>

[Chorus]
And he bad, bad Leroy Brown                        <G>---
The baddest man in the whole damned town           <Am>---
Badder than old King Kong                          <B7>- <C>-
And meaner than a junkyard dog                     <D> <C> <G> <D7>

[Verse]
Now Friday 'bout a week ago                        <G>---
Leroy shootin' dice                                <Am>---
And at the edge of the bar sat a girl name Doris   <B7>- <C>-
and oo, that girl looked nice                      <D> <C> <G> <D7>

[Verse]
Well he cast his eyes upon her                     <G>---
and the trouble soon began                         <Am>---
Leroy Brown learned a lesson 'bout messin'         <B7>- <C>-
With the wife of a jealous man                     <D> <C> <G> <D7>

[Chorus]
And he bad, bad Leroy Brown                        <G>---
The baddest man in the whole damned town           <Am>---
Badder than old King Kong                          <B7>- <C>-
And meaner than a junkyard dog                     <D> <C> <G> <D7>

[Verse]
Well the two men took to fighting                  <G>---
And when they pulled them from the floor           <Am>---
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle                  <B7>- <C>-
With a couple of pieces gone.                      <D> <C> <G> <D7>

[Chorus]
And he bad, bad Leroy Brown                        <G>---
The baddest man in the whole damned town           <Am>---
Badder than old King Kong                          <B7>- <C>-
And meaner than a junkyard dog                     <D> <C> <G> <D7>

[Chorus]
And he bad, bad Leroy Brown                        <G>---
The baddest man in the whole damned town           <Am>---
Badder than old King Kong                          <B7>- <C>-
And meaner than a junkyard dog                     <D> <C> <G> <D7>
