  - E Verse: |
      (1)
      (2)
      I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
      I keep my eyes wide open all the time
      I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
      Because you're mine, I walk the line

  - A Verse: |
      (1)
      (2)
      I find it very, very easy to be true
      I find myself alone when each day's through
      Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
      Because you're mine, I walk the line

  - D Verse: |
      (1)
      (2)
      As sure as night is dark and day is light
      I keep you on my mind both day and night
      And happiness I've known proves that it's right
      Because you're mine, I walk the line

  - A Verse: |
      (1)
      (2)
      You've got a way to keep me on your side
      You give me cause for love that I can't hide
      For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
      Because you're mine, I walk the line

  - E Verse: |
      (1)
      (2)
      I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
      I keep my eyes wide open all the time
      I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
      Because you're mine, I walk the line
