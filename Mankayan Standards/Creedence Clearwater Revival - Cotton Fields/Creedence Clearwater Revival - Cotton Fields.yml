  - Verse: |
      When I was a little bitty baby
      My mama would rock me in the cradle
      In them old cotton fields back home
      ....

  - Chorus: |
      It was down in Louisiana
      Just about a mile from Texarkana
      In them old cotton fields back home
      ....

  - Bridge: |
      Oh, when them cotton bolls get rotten
      You can't pick very much cotton
      In them old cotton fields back home
      ....
