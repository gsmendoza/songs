  - Verse: |
      You said you hurtin', you almost lost your mind
      Now the man you love he hurt you all the time
      But when things go wrong, go wrong with you
      It hurts me too

  - Verse: |
      You love him more, when you should love him less
      Why pick up behind him and take his mess
      But when things go wrong, wrong with you
      It hurts me too

  - Verse: |
      He love another woman, yes I love you
      But you love him and stick to him like glue
      When things go wrong, go wrong with you
      It hurts me too

  - Verse (last): |
      Now he'd better leave you, or you better put him down
      No, I won't stand to see you pushed around
      But when things go wrong, go wrong with you
      It hurts me too
