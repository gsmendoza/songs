  - Verse A: |
      It's knowing that your door is always open
      And your path is free to walk
      ....
      ....

      That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
      Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
      ....
      ....

      And it's knowing I'm not shackled
      By forgotten words and bonds
      And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
      ....
      ....

      That keeps you in the back roads
      By the rivers of my memory
      That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
      ....
      ....

  - Verse A: |
      It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
      Planted on their columns now that bind me
      ....
      ....

      Or something that somebody said
      Because they thought we fit together walking
      ....
      ....

      It's just knowing that the world
      will not be cursing or forgiving
      When I walk along some railroad track and find
      ....
      ....

      That you're moving on the back roads
      by the rivers of my memory
      And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
      ....
      ....

  - Verse A: |
      Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
      And the junkyards and the highways come between us
      ....
      ....

      And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
      'Cause she turned and I was gone
      ....
      ....

      I still might run in silence,
      tears of joy might stain my face
      And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
      ....
      ....

      But not to where I cannot see you
      Walkin' on the back roads,
      by the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
      ....
      ....

  - Verse B: |
      I dip my cup of soup back
      From a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
      ....
      ....

      My beard, a roughening' coal pile
      And a dirty hat pulled low across my face,
      ....
      ....

      Through cupped hands 'round the tin can,
      I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
      ....
      ....

      That you're waiting from the back roads
      by the rivers of my memories
      Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind
      ....
      ....
