  - Verse: |
      It's been a long dark night
      And I've been a-waiting for
        the morning

      It's been a long hard fight
      But I see a brand new day
        a-dawning

      I've been looking for
        the sunshine
      You know I ain't seen it
        in so long

      But everything's gonna work out
        just fine
      And everything's gonna be all right, that's been
        all wrong

  - Chorus A: |
      'Cause I can see the light of a
        clear blue morning
      I can see the light of a
        brand new day

      I can see the light of a
        clear blue morning

      Oh and everything's gonna be all right
      It's gonna be okay

  - Interlude: |
      ....

  - Verse: |
      It's been a long long time
      Since I've known the taste
        of freedom

      And those clinging vines
      That had me bound, well I don't
        need 'em

      I've been like a
        captured eagle
      You know an eagle is
        born to fly

      Now that I have won
        my freedom
      Like an eagle, I am eager
        for the sky

  - Chorus A: |
      But I can see the light of a
        clear blue morning
      I can see the light of a
        brand new day

      I can see the light of a
        clear blue morning

      Oh and everything's gonna be all right
      It's gonna be okay

  - Chorus B: |
      I can see the light of a
        clear blue morning
      I can see the light of a
        brand new day

      I can see the light of a
        clear blue morning

      Oh and everything's gonna be all right
      Everything's gonna be all right

      Everything's gonna be all right
      It's gonna be ok

  - Chorus B: |
      But I can see the light of a
        clear blue morning
      I can see the light of a
        brand new day

      I can see the light of a
        clear blue morning

      Oh and everything's gonna be all right
      Everything's gonna be all right

      Everything's gonna be all right
      It's gonna be ok

  - Chorus B: |
      And I can see the light of a
        clear blue morning
      I can see the light of a
        brand new day

      I can see the light of a
        clear blue morning

      Oh and everything's gonna be all right
      Everything's gonna be all right

      Everything's gonna be all right
      It's gonna be ok
