Alan Simmons - Flying

Key: C

[Verse]
<C>- <Dm>-       Look at the birds, see how they fly
<G>- <C>-        Borne on the wind and gently floating
<F>- <Em>-       Spreading their wings against the sky
<Dm> <G> <C>-    Gracefully glide into the night

[Verse]
<C>- <Dm>-       Fly... into the
<G>- <C>-        clouds... suspended high
<F>- <Em>-       In a balloon we gently
<Dm> <G> <C>-    Swing and sway

[Verse]
<C>- <Dm>-       When you're flying up in an aeroplane
<G>- <C>-        All the world looks small, see
<F>- <Em>-       Tiny boats go sailing from
<Dm> <G> <C>-    Tiny shores
