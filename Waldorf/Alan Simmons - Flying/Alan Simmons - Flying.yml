lyrics: 
  - Verse: |
      Look at the birds, see how they fly
      Borne on the wind and gently floating
      Spreading their wings against the sky
      Gracefully glide into the night

  - Verse: |
      Fly... into the
      clouds... suspended high
      In a balloon we gently
      Swing and sway

  - Verse: |
      When you're flying up in an aeroplane
      All the world looks small, see
      Tiny boats go sailing from
      Tiny shores
