lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      ... ... ... ...
  - Chorus: |
      Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing,
      Onward! the sailors cry;
      Carry the lad that's born to be king
      Over the sea to Skye.

  - Verse: |
      Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar,
      Thunderclaps rend the air;
      Baffled, our foes stand by the shore,
      Follow they will not dare.

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      Many's the lad, fought on that day
      Well the claymore did wield;
      When the night came, silently lay
      Dead on Culloden's field.

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep,
      Ocean's a royal bed.
      Rocked in the deep, Flora will keep
      Watch by your weary head.

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      Burned are their homes, exile and death
      Scatter the loyal men;
      Yet ere the sword cool in the sheath
      Charlie will come again.

  - Chorus
