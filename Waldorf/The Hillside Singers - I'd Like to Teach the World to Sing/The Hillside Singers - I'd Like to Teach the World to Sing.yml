lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      I'd like to build the world a home
      And furnish it with love
      Grow apple trees and honey bees
      And snow white turtle doves
 
  - Verse: |
      I'd like to teach the world to sing
      In perfect harmony
      I'd like to hold it in my arms
      And keep it company

  - Verse: |
      I'd like to see the world for once
      All standing hand in hand
      And hear them echo through the hills
      For peace throughout the land

  - Verse: |
      It's the real thing, what the world wants today
      That's the way it'll stay
      With the real thing
      (Peace and love) It's the real thing

  - Verse: |
      I'd like to teach the world to sing
      In perfect harmony
      A song of peace that echoes love
      And never goes away

  - Bridge: |
      Put your hand in my hand
      Let's begin today
      With your hand in my hand
      Help me find a way

  - Verse (Capo on 2nd): |
      I'd like to see the world for once
      All standing hand in hand
      And hear them echo through the hills
      For peace throughout the land

  - Verse (Capo on 2nd): |
      I'd like to teach the world to sing
      In perfect harmony
      A song of peace that echoes love
      And never goes away

  - Outro (Fade): |
      I'd like to teach the world to sing
      In perfect harmony
