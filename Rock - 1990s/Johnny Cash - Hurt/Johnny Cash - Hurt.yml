lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .... .. ..
      .... .. ..

  - Verse: |
      I hurt myself today
      To see if I still feel
      I focus on the pain
      The only thing that's real

  - Verse: |
      The needle tears a hole
      The old familiar sting
      Try to kill it all away
      But I remember everything

  - Chorus: |
      What have I become
      My sweetest friend
      Everyone I know
      Goes away in the end

      And you could have it all
      My empire of dirt
      I will let you down
      I will make you hurt

  - Interlude: |
      .... .. ..
      .... .. ..

  - Verse: |
      I wear this crown of thorns
      Upon my liar's chair
      Full of broken thoughts
      I cannot repair

  - Verse: |
      Beneath the stains of time
      The feelings disappear
      You are someone else
      I am still right here

  - Chorus

  - Outro: |
      If I could start again
      A million miles away
      I will keep myself
      I will find away
