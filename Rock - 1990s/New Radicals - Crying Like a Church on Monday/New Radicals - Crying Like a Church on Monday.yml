lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. .. ....
      .. .. ....

  - Verse: |
      I was dancing with your shadow
      Slow down, memories hall

      I said, "Wait, have I been seduced and forgotten?"
      You said, "Baby, haven't we all?"

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      Now I don't like crying
      'Cause it only gets me wet

      But I can't help failing
      To remember to forget you
      And I know it's gonna be a long time

  - Chorus: |
      Now I'm crying like a church on Monday
      Praying for these feelings to go away
      So do me a favor baby, put down your new God
      And love me like Sunday again

  - Interlude: |
      Whoa whoa
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      I was hiding in your bedroom
      When I saw him come inside

      I can't live, oh in his shadow
      Is that where I'm dancing till I die?

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      Now I don't light candles
      'Cause they make see the light

      But I can't help failing
      To remember to forget you
      And I know it's gonna be a long time

  - Chorus 2: |
      Now I'm crying like a church on Monday
      Praying for these feelings to go away
      So do me a favor baby, put down your new God
      And love me like Sunday again
