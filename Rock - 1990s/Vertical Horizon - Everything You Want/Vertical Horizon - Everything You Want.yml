- Verse: |-
    Somewhere there's speaking
    It's already coming in
    Oh and it's rising
    at the back of your mind

    You never could get it
    Unless you were fed it
    Now you're here
    and you don't know why

- Verse: |-
    But under skinned knees
    and the skid marks
    Past the places
    where you used to learn

    You howl and listen
    Listen and wait for the
    Echoes of angels
    who won't return

- Chorus: |-
    He's everything you want
    He's everything you need
    He's everything inside of you
    That you wish you could be

    He says all the right things
    At exactly the right time
    But he means nothing to you
    And you don't know why

- Verse: |-
    You're waiting for someone
    To put you together
    You're waiting for someone
    to push you away

    There's always another
    wound to discover
    There's always something more
    you wish he'd say

- Chorus

- Bridge: |-
    But you'll just sit tight
    And watch it unwind
    It's only what
    you're asking for

    And you'll be just fine
    With all of your time
    It's only what
    you're waiting for

    ....

- Verse: |-
    Out of the island
    Into the highway
    Past the places
    where you might have turned

    You never did notice
    But you still hide away
    The anger of angels
    who won't return

- Chorus

- Chorus: |-
    I am everything you want
    I am everything you need
    I am everything inside of you
    That you wish you could be

    I say all the right things
    At exactly the right time
    But I mean nothing to you
    and I don't know why

- Outro: |-
    ....
    And I don't know why
    ....
    Why

    ...
    And I don't know
