  - Verse 1: |
      *Summer* time and the wind is blowin' outside
      In lower *Chelsea* and I don't know what I'm doing in this city
      The sun is always in my *eyes*
      It crashes through the *windows* and I'm sleeping on the couch

      When I came to visit *you*
      That's when I knew that I could never *have* you
      I knew that before *you* did
      Still I'm the one who's *stupid*

  - Refrain 1: |
      And there's this *burning*
      Like there's *always* been
      I've *never* been so alone
      And *I've* never been so alive

  - Interlude: |
      ....

  - Verse 2: |
      *Visions* of you on a motorcycle drive by
      The *cigarette* ash flies in your eyes and you don't mind,
      You *smile* and *say* the world
      It doesn't *fit* with you, I don't *believe* you, you're so serene

      *Careening* through the universe,
      your axis on a *tilt*. You're guiltless and *free*,
      I hope you take a piece of *me* with you

      And there's *things* I would like to do
      that you don't *believe* in
      I would like to *build* something
      But you'll never see it *happen*

  - Refrain 2: |
      And there's this *burnin'*
      Like there's *always* been
      I've *never* been so alone
      And *I've*, I've never been so alive

      And there's this *burning*
      There is this *burning*

  - Verse 3: |
      *Where's* the soul, I wanna know
      New York City's *evil*, the surface is everything
      but I could never *do* that
      Someone would see *through* that

      And this is the *last* time,
      We'll be *friends* again
      And *I'll* get over you,
      You'll wonder *who* I am

  - Refrain 3: |
      And there's this *burning*
      Just like there's *always* been
      I've *never* been so alone, alone
      And *I've* and I've,

      I've never been so *alive*
      So *alive*

  - Verse 4: |
      *I* go home to the coast, it starts to rain
      I paddle out *on* the water alone
      Taste the *salt* and taste the pain, I'm not *thinking* of you again

      *Summer* dies and swells rise
      The sun goes down in *my* eyes
      See this rolling wave darkly *coming*
      To take me *home*
      ....

  - Refrain 4: |
      And I've *never* been so alone
      And *I've* never been so alive
