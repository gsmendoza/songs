  - Verse 1: |
      Hello there,
      the angel from my nightmare
      The shadow in the background of
      the morgue

      The unsuspecting victim
      of darkness in the valley
      We can live like Jack and Sally if
      we want

      Where you can always find me,
      We'll have Halloween on Christmas
      And in the night we'll wish this never ends,
      we'll wish this never ends

  - Chorus: |
      .. ..

      ....
      (I miss you, miss you)

  - Verse 2: |
      Where are you
      and I'm so sorry
      I cannot sleep I cannot dream
      tonight

      I need somebody and always
      this sick strange darkness
      Comes creeping in so haunting
      every time.

      And as I stared I counted
      webs from all the spiders
      Catching things and eating their
      insides

      Like indecision to call you
      and hear your voice of treason
      Will you come home and stop this pain tonight,
      stop this pain tonight

  - Chorus: |
      Don't waste your time
      on me you're already
      The voice inside my head
      (I miss you, miss you)

      Don't waste your time on me
      you're already
      The voice inside my head
      (I miss you, miss you)

      you're already
      The voice inside my head
      (I miss you, miss you)

      Don't waste your time
