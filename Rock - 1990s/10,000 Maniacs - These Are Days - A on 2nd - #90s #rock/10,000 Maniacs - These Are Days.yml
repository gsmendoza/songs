lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .... ....
      .... These are

      the days

      .... ....
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      These are days
      you'll remember

      Never before and never since
      I promise

      Will the whole world be warm as this
      And as you feel it

  - Chorus: |
      You'll know it's true
      That you are blessed and lucky

      It's true that you
      Are touched by something

      That will grow in bloom in you

  - Interlude: |
      .... ....
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      These are days
      you'll remember

      When May is rushing over you
      with desire

      To be part of the miracles you see
      in every hour

  - Chorus

  - Solo: |
      .... ....
      .... ....

      These are
      days

  - Last Chorus: |
      These are the days you might fill with laughter
      until you break

      These days you might feel a shaft of light
      Make its way across your face

      And when you do you'll know
      how it was meant to be, see the signs and know their meaning

      It's true, you'll know
      how it was meant to be, hear the signs and know they're speaking

      to you, to you

  - Outro: |
      .... ....
      .... ....

      O-oh-oh O-oh-oh
      O-oh-oh O-oh-oh

      Mmmm ....
      .... ....

      Mmmm ....
      .... ....
