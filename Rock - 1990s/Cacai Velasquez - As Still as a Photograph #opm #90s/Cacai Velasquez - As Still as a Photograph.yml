  - Verse 1: |
      I used to say that I'd readily swim the seven seas for you
      Now, I can't reach the shore
      I used to say that only I held the key to your heart
      Now, I can't find the door

  - Chorus 1: |
      Slowly fading like a painting on your wall
      Yet as clear as the sound of your laugh

      Forever captured in my mind you'll remain

      As still as a
      photograph

  - Verse 2: |
      My shoes are now worn from walking too far
      Still farther I go,
      My hands are so tired from hiding the scar
      Still I refuse to show

      And though I know that it's wrong, you're still my concern
      Like a thorn in my side,
      It's hard to be strong when you've nowhere to turn
      When you've nowhere to hide

  - Chorus 2: |
      Slowly fading like a painting on your wall
      Yet as clear as the sound of your laugh

      Forever captured in my mind you'll remain

      As still as a
      photograph

      As still as a
      photograph

  - Verse 3: |
      And though the wound burns, it's mine to keep
      ....
      To hold in my arms, and to sing me to sleep,
      ....

      For it's all that I have, I now realize,
      ....
      The memory lives (when reality dies)
      When reality dies

  - Chorus 3: |
      Slowly fading like a painting on your wall
      Yet as clear as the sound of your laugh

      Forever captured in my mind you'll remain

      As still as a
      photograph

  - Chorus 4: |
      Slowly fading like a painting on your wall
      Yet as clear as the sound of your laugh

      Forever captured in my mind you'll remain

      As still as a
      photograph

      As still as a
      photograph

      As still as a
      photograph
