  - Verse: |
      Slip inside
      the eye of your
      mind

      Don't you know you might
      find

      A better place
      to play?
      ..

      You said
      that you'd never
      been

      But all the things that you've
      seen

      Will slowly fade
      away
      ..

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      So I start
      a revolution from my
      bed
      ..

      'Cause you said the brains
      I had went to my
      head
      ..

      Step outside,
      summertime's in
      bloom
      ..

      Stand up beside
      the fireplace
      Take that look
      from off your face

      You ain't ever
      gonna burn my
      heart out
      ..

      ..
      ..
      ..
      ..

  - Chorus A: |
      And so,
      Sally can
      wait

      She knows it's too
      late

      as we're walkin' on
      by
      ..

      Her soul
      slides
      away

      "But don't look
      back in anger,"

      I heard you

  - Verse: |
      Take me to
      the place where you
      go

      Where nobody
      knows

      If it's night or
      day
      ..

      Please don't put
      your life in the
      hands

      Of a rock 'n' roll
      band

      Who'll throw it all
      away
      ..
