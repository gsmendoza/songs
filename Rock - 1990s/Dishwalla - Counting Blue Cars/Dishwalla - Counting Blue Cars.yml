  - Verse: |
      Must've been mid afternoon
      .... ....

      I could tell by
      how far the child's shadow stretched out and

      He walked with a purpose
      in his sneakers, down the street, he had

      Many questions
      like children often do. He said:

  - Chorus 1: |
      Tell me all your thoughts on God
      .... ....

      Tell me am I very far
      .... ....


  - Interlude: |
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      Must've been late afternoon
      .... ....

      On our way
      the sun broke free of the clouds

      We count only blue cars
      skip the cracks in the street and ask

      Many questions
      like children often do. We said:

  - Chorus 2: |
      Tell me all your thoughts on God
      'Cause I'd really like to meet her

      And ask her why we're who we are
      .... ....

      Tell me all your thoughts on God
      'Cause I'm on my way to see her

      So tell me am I very far,
      Am I very far now?

  - Verse: |
      It's getting cold, picked up the pace!
      .... ....

      How our shoes
      make hard noises in this place!

      Our clothes are stained
      We pass many cross-eyed people and ask

      Many questions
      Like children often do

  - Chorus 3: |
      Tell me all your thoughts on God
      'Cause I'd really like to meet her

      And ask her why we're who we are
      .... ....

      Tell me all your thoughts on God
      'Cause I'm on my way to see her

      So tell me am I very far,
      We're not very far now

  - Outro: |
      We're not very far now
      We're not very far now

      (Tell me all your thoughts on God)
      .... ....

      (Tell me all your thoughts on God)
      .... ....
