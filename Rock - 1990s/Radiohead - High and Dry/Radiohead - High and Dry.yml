  - Verse: |
      Two jumps in a week
      I bet you think that's pretty clever
      Don't you boy?
      ....

      Flying on your motorcycle
      Watching all the ground
      beneath you drop
      ....

      You'd kill yourself for recognition
      Kill yourself to never
      ever stop
      ....

      You broke another mirror
      You're turning into something
      you are not
      ....

  - Chorus 1: |
      Don't leave me *high*
      Don't leave me
      dry
      ....

      Don't leave me *high*
      Don't leave me
      dry
      ....

  - Verse: |
      Drying up in conversation
      You will be the one who
      cannot talk
      ....

      All your insides fall to pieces
      You just sit there wishing you could
      still make love
      ....

      They're the ones who'll hate you
      When you think you've got the world
      all sussed out
      ....

      They're the ones who'll spit at you
      You will be the one
      screaming out
      ....

  - Chorus 2: |
      Don't leave me *high*
      Don't leave me
      dry
      ....

      Don't leave me *high*
      Don't leave me

  - Bridge: |
      It's the best thing that you've ever had
      The best thing that you've ever,
      ever had
      ....

      It's the best thing that you've ever had
      The best thing you've had
      has gone away
      ....
