lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      ....
      ....
      ....
      ....

      ....
      ....
      ....
      ....

  - Verse: |
      And even though the moment passed me by
      I still can't turn away
      ....
      ....

      'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
      Got tossed along the way
      ....
      ....

      And letters that you never meant to send
      Get lost or thrown away
      ....
      ....

  - Chorus: |
      And now we're grown up orphans that
      never knew their names

      We don't belong to no one
      That's a shame

      You could hide beside me
      Maybe for a while

      And I won't tell no one
      your name
      And I won't tell 'em your name

      ....
      ....
      ....
      ....

  - Verse: |
      And scars are souvenirs you never lose
      The past is never far
      ....
      ....

      Did you lose yourself somewhere out there
      Did you get to be a star?
      ....
      ....

      And don't it make you sad to know that life
      Is more than who we are?
      ....
      ....

  - Chorus 2: |
      We grew up way too fast
      And now there's nothing to believe

      And reruns all become
      our history

      A tired song keeps playing on
      a tired radio

      And I won't tell no one
      your name
      And I won't tell 'em your name

      ....
      I won't tell 'em your name
      ....
      ....

      ....
      I won't tell 'em your name, ow
      ....
      ....

  - Solo: |

      ....
      ....

      ....
      ....

      ....
      ....

  - Outro: |
      I think about you all the time
      But I don't need the same
      ....
      ....

      It's lonely where you are, come back down
      And I won't tell 'em your name
      ....
      ....
