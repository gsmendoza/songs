  - Verse A: |
      Walk blindly into the light and reach out for his hand
      Don’t ask any questions and don’t try to understand
      Open up your mind and then open up your heart
      And you will see that you and me aren’t very far apart

  - Chorus A: |
      Cause I believe that love is the answer
      I believe love will find the way
 
  - Verse A: |
      Violence is spread world wide and there are families on the street
      And we sell drugs to children now oh why can’t we just see
      That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
      Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay

  - Chorus B: |
      But I believe that love is the answer
      I believe love will find the way
      I believe that love is the answer
      I believe love will find the way

  - Verse B: |
      I’ve been seeing Lisa now for a little over a year
      She said she’s never been so happy but Lisa lives in fear
      That one day daddy’s gonna find out she’s in love with a nigger from the streets
      Oh how he would lose it then but she’s still here with me
      Cause she believes that love will see it through and one day he’ll understand
      And he’ll see me as a person and not just a black man

  - Chorus B: |
      Cause I believe that love is the answer
      I believe love will find the way
      I believe I believe I believe I believe that love is the answer
      I believe love will find the way

  - Outro: |
      Love will find the way
      Love will find the way
      Love will find the way

      Love will find the way
      Love will find the way
      Love will find the way
      Love will find the way
