  - Verse: |
      We passed upon the stair
      We spoke of was and when
      Although I wasn't there
      He said I was his friend

      Which came as a surprise
      I spoke into his eyes
      I thought you died alone
      A long, long time ago

  - Chorus: |
      Oh no, not me
      We never lost control
      You're face to face
      With the man who sold the world

  - Interlude A: |

  - Verse: |
      I laughed and shook his hand
      And made my way back home
      I searched for form and land
      For years and years I roamed

      I gazed a gazeless stare
      We walked a million hills
      I must have died alone
      A long, long time ago

  - Chorus: |
      Who knows? Not me
      I never lost control
      You're face to face
      With the man who sold the world

  - Interlude B: |
      .... ....
      .... ....

  - Chorus: |
      Who knows? Not me
      We never lost control
      You're face to face
      With the man who sold the world
