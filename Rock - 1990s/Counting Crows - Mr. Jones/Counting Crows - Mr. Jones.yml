lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      ....
      Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
      ....
      Mm, uh-huh

  - Verse: |
      I was down at the New Amsterdam
      Staring at this yellow-haired girl
      Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
      With a black-haired flamenco dancer

  - Verse: |
      You know, she dances while his father plays guitar
      She's suddenly beautiful
      And we all want something beautiful
      Man, I wish I was beautiful

  - Verse: |
      So come dance this silence down through the morning
      Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
      yeah
      Uh-huh, yeah

  - Verse: |
      Cut up, Maria
      Show me some of them Spanish dances and
      Pass me a bottle,
      Mr. Jones

  - Verse: |
      Believe in me
      Help me believe in anything
      'Cause I wanna be someone who believes
      Yeah

  - Chorus: |
      Mr. Jones and me
      Tell each other fairy tales
      And we stare at them beautiful women
      She's looking at you, oh no, no, she's looking at me

      Smiling in the bright lights
      Coming through in stereo
      When everybody loves you
      You can never be lonely

  - Verse: |
      Well, I'm gon' paint my picture
      Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
      All of the beautiful colors
      are very, very meaningful

  - Verse: |
      Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
      I felt so symbolic yesterday
      If I knew Picasso
      I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

  - Chorus: |
      Mr. Jones and me
      Look into the future
      Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
      She's looking at you, I don't think so, she's looking at me

      Standing in the spotlight
      I bought myself a gray guitar
      When everybody loves me
      I will never be lonely

  - Bridge: |
      I will never be
      lonely
      Said, I'm never gonna be
      lonely

      I wanna be a lion
      Yeah, everybody wanna pass as cats
      We all wanna be big, big stars
      Yeah, but we got different reasons for that

      Believe in me
      'Cause I don't believe in anything
      And I, I wanna be someone to believe
      To believe, to believe, yeah

  - Chorus: |
      Mr. Jones and me
      Stumbling through the barrio
      Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
      She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me

      I wanna be Bob Dylan
      Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
      When everybody loves you
      Oh son, that's just about as funky as you can be

  - Chorus: |
      Mr. Jones and me
      Staring at the video
      When I look at the television, I wanna see me
      Staring right back at me

      We all wanna be big stars
      But we don't know why and we don't know how
      But when everybody loves me
      I wanna be just about as happy as I can be

  - Outro: |
      Mr. Jones and me
      We're gonna be big stars
