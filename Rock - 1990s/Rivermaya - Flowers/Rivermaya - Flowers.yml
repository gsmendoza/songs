  - Verse: |
      Someone's gone away forever
      Someone's gone away too soon
      Did they take him up to heaven
      Or did they take him to the moon

  - Chorus: |
      Nobody answers all her questions
      So she gazes at the skies
      Maybe someday when she's all grown up
      She'll join them in their lies

      And just before she turns away
      She crafts a little smile
      "Someday I will take these flowers
        to the sky"

  - Interlude: |
      .... .... .... ....

  - Chorus 2: |
      Nobody answers all her questions
      So she gazes at the skies
      Maybe someday when she's all grown up
      She'll join them in their lies

      And just before she turns away
      She crafts a little smile
      Saying "I will take these flowers
        to the sky"

      "Someday I will take these flowers
        to the sky"
