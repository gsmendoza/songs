  - Verse: |
      A long December and there's reason to believe
      Maybe this year will be better than the last
      I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin'
      Now the days go by so fast

  - Refrain: |
      And it's one more day up in the canyons
      And it's one more night in Hollywood
      If you think that I could be forgiven
      I wish you would

  - Chorus: |
      Nananana, na nana nana nananana
      Nananana, yeah

  - Verse: |
      The smell of hospitals in winter
      And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
      All at once you look across a crowded room
      To see the way that light attaches to a girl

  - Refrain: |
      And it's one more day up in the canyons
      And it's one more night in Hollywood
      If you think you might come to California
      I think you should

  - Chorus

  - Solo: |

  - Verse: |
      Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
      And talked a little while about the year
      I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,
      Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her

  - Verse: |
      And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
      Maybe this year will be better than the last
      I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself
      To hold on to these moments as they pass

  - Refrain: |
      And it's one more day up in the canyon
      And it's one more night in Hollywood
      It's been so long since I've seen the ocean
      I guess I should
