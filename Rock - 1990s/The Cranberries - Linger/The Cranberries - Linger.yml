  - Verse: |
      If _you_, if you could return.
      Don't let it _burn_. Don't let it fade.
      I'm sure I'm not being _rude_. But it's just your attitude.
      It's tearing me _apart_. It's ruining every day.
 
  - Verse: |
      I _swore_, I swore I would be true.
      And honey so did _you_.
      So why were you holding her _hand_? Is that the way we stand?
      Were you lying all the _time_? Was it just a game to you?

  - Chorus: |
      But I'm in so _deep_.
      You know I'm such a _fool_ for you.
      You got me wrapped around your _finger_.
      Do you have to let it _linger_? Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

  - Verse: |
      Oh,
      I _thought_ the world of you.
      I thought _nothing_ could go wrong.
      But I was _wrong_, I was wrong.

  - Verse: |
      If _you_, if you could get by.
      Trying not to _lie_.
      Things wouldn't be so _confused_. And I wouldn't feel so used.
      But you always really _knew_ I just want to be with you.
