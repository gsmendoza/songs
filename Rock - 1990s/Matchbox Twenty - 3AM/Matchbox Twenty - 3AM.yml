  - Verse: |
      She said, "It's
      cold outside, " and she hands me my raincoat
      .. ..
      .. ..

      She's always
      worried about things like that
      .. ..
      .. ..

      Well, she said,
      "It's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault"
      .. ..
      .. ..

      And she only sleeps
      when it's raining
      And she screams,
      and her voice is straining

  - Chorus: |
      She says, "Baby,
      it's 3 AM, I must be lonely"
      .. ..
      ....

      And she says, "Baby,
      well, I can't help but be scared of it
      all sometimes
      And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe it"

      Well, she's got a
      little bit of something, God, it's better than nothing

      .. ..

      And in her color
      portrait world, she believes that she's got it all
      .. ..
      .. ..

      She swears the moon
      don't hang quite as high as it used to
      .. ..
      .. ..

      And she only sleeps
      when it's raining,
      And she screams (screams)
      and her voice is straining

      She says, "Baby,
      well, it's 3 AM, I must be lonely"
      .. ..

      Well, she believes
      that life isn't made up of all that you're used to

      .. ..

      And the clock
      on the wall has been stuck at 3 for days and days
      .. ..
      .. ..

      She thinks
      that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway

      But outside,
      it's stopped raining
