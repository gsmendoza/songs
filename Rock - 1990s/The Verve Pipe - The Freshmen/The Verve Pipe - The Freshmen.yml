  - Verse: |
      When I was young I knew
        everything
      And she a punk who rarely ever
        took advice

      Now i'm guilt stricken, sobbing with my
        head on the floor
      Stop a baby's breath and a
        shoe full of rice

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      .. ..
      I can't be held responsible

      .. ..
      Cause she was touching her face

      .. ..
      I won't be held responsible

      .. ..
      She fell in love in the first place

  - Chorus: |
      For the life of me
      I cannot remember
      What made us think that we were wise
      and we'd never compromise

      For the life of me
      I cannot believe
      we'd ever die for these sins
      We were merely freshmen

  - Verse: |
      My best friend took a week's
        vacation to forget her
      His girl took a week's worth of
        valium and slept

      Now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his
        head on the floor
      Thinks about her now and how he
        never really wept he says

  - Verse: |
      We've tried to wash our hands of
        all of this
      We never talk of our lacking
        relationships

      And how we're guilt stricken sobbing with our
        heads on the floor
      We fell through the ice when we
        tried not to slip, we'd say
