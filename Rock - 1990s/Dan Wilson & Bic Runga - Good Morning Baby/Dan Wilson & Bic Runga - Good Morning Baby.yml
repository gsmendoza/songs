lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      Aha, aha...
      Aha, aha...

  - Verse: |
      Between an overload of information and a striving for a pure dedication I
      Find myself looking for the exit sign
      See your pretty face in the sunshine in the morning after staying up all night I
      Want to wake you just to hear you tell me it's alright
      And all I want to be is too much sometimes for me

  - Chorus 1: |
      Good morning baby I hope I'm gonna make it through another day
      Good morning baby I hope I'm gonna make it through another day

  - Verse: |
      I see the stars and all the planets fly the great wide world and have it all
      Yeah better get a ticket better get in line
      I'm praying now for beautiful weather, take a car and drive forever but I'm
      Only ever sitting at the traffic light
      And all the world to see is too much sometimes for me

  - Chorus 2: |
      Good morning baby I hope I'm gonna make it through another day
      Good morning baby I hope I'm gonna make it through another day
      Good morning baby I hope I'm gonna make it through another day
      Good morning baby I hope I'm gonna make it through another day

  - Bridge: |
      (And when you rise) And when you rise you'll find me here
      (Open your eyes) And see myself reflected there
      (And for awhile) A little room becomes an everywhere
      ...

  - Interlude: |
      Aaaha, aha ...
      Aaaha, aha ...

  - Verse 1 (Repeat): |
      Between an overload of information and a striving for a pure dedication I
