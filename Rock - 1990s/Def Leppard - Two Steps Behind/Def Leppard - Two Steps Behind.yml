lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..

  - Verse: |
      Walk away, if you want to
      It's okay, if you need to
      You can run but you can never hide
      From the shadow that's creepin' up beside you

  - Pre-chorus: |
      There's a magic runnin' through your soul
      But you can't have it all

  - Chorus: |
      (Whatever you do) I'll be two steps behind you
      (Wherever you go) And I'll be there to remind you
      That it only takes a minute of your precious time
      To turn around, I'll be two steps behind

  - Break: |
      .. .. .. ..
      Yea, yea

  - Verse: |
      Take the time to think about it
      Just walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
      Take a look around you'll see what you can find
      Like the fire that's burnin' up inside me

  - Pre-chorus: |
      Now there's a magic runnin' through your soul
      But you can't have it all, no

  - Chorus: |
      (Whatever you do) I'll be two steps behind you
      (Wherever you go) And I'll be there to remind you
      That it only takes a minute of your precious time
      To turn around, I'll be two steps behind

  - Break: |
      .. .. .. ..
      Yea, yea, Oh, ho

  - Solo: |
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..

  - Pre-chorus: |
      Oh, there's a magic running through your soul
      But you, you can't have it all

  - Chorus: |
      (Whatever you do) I'll be two steps behind you
      (Wherever you go) And I'll be there to remind you
      That it only takes a minute of your precious time
      To turn around, I'll be two steps behind

  - Outro: |
      Yea baby, two steps behind
      Oh sugar, two steps behind
      ....
