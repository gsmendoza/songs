  - Verse: |
      You're the one that never lets me sleep
      To my mind, down to my soul, you touch my lips
      You're the one that I can't wait to see
      With you here by my side I'm in ecstasy

  - Refrain: |
      I am all alone without you
      My days are dark without a glimpse of you
      But now that you came into my life I feel complete
      The flowers bloom, my morning shines and I can see
      ...

  - Chorus: |
      Your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world
      I feel the warmth inside
      Your love is like a river that flows down through my veins
      I feel the chill inside

  - Interlude: |
      (1)
      (2)

  - Verse: |
      Everytime I hear our music played
      Reminds me of the things that we've been through
      In my mind I can't believe it's true
      But in my heart, the reality is you
