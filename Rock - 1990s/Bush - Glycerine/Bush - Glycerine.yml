  - Verse 1: |
      It must be your skin, I'm sinkin' in
      It must be for real, 'cause now I can feel
      And I didn't mind, it's not my kind
      It's not my time, to wonder why

      Everything gone white, everything's grey
      Now you're here, now you're away
      I don't want this, remember that
      I'll never forget, where you're at

  - Chorus 1: |
      Don't let the
      days go by

      Glycerine,
      glycerine

  - Verse 2: |
      I'm never alone, I'm alone all the time
      Are you at one, or do you lie
      We live in a wheel, where everyone steals
      But when we rise, it's like strawberry fields

      If I treated you bad, you'd bruise my face
      Couldn't love you more, you've got a beautiful taste

  - Chorus 2: |
      Don't let the
      days go by

      Could have been easier on you
      I couldn't change though I wanted to
      Should have been easier by three
      Our old friend fear and you and me

      Glycerine,
      glycerine

      Don't let the
      days go by, glycerine
      Don't let the
      days go by

      Ah, ah-ah-ah,
      ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

      .... ....
      Glycerine, glycerine
      .... ....
      Oh, glycerine, glycerine

  - Bridge: |
      Bad moon whine again
      Bad moon whine again
      As she falls around me

  - Verse 3: |
      I needed you more, we wanted us less
      Could not kiss, just regress
      It might just be me, simple, and plain
      Well that's just fine, that's just one of my names

  - Chorus 3: |
      Don't let the
      days go by
      Could've been easier on you
      you you

      Glycerine,
      glycerine
      Glycerine,
      glycerine

      ....
