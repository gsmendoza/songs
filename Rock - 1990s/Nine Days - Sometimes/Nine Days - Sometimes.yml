  - Verse: |
      Shadows they fall
      On the stage of your own life
      Trailing behind
      footsteps

      There's comfort in ghosts
      Who are no longer with you
      Hiding behind
      your steps

  - Pre-chorus 1: |
      I let you down
      You've lost your taste
      I'm losing ground
      I fall from grace

      Well just listen
      Sometimes

  - Chorus 1: |
      You gotta set free what you love
      Just to bring it back
      Would you ever lose me?
      Would you ever let go for that?

      And if the love is real, you gotta let yourself go
      Just to bring it back,
      Sometimes
      Just to bring it back

  - Interlude: |

  - Verse: |
      Hiding inside
      my asylum I'm always
      hanging on by
      a thread

      I can't expect you
      to respect me until I've
      learned to respect
      myself

  - Pre-chorus 2: |
      I let you down
      You've lost your taste
      I'm losing ground
      I miss your face

      Well just listen
      Just listen
      Sometimes
      Sometimes

  - Chorus 2: |
      You gotta set free what you love
      Just to bring it back
      Would you ever lose me?
      Would you ever let go for that?

      And if the love is real, you gotta let yourself go
      Just to bring it back,
      Sometimes, just to bring it back
      The love you're bringing back

  - Pre-chorus 3: |
      I let you down
      You've lost your taste
      I'm losing ground

  - Chorus 3: |
      You gotta set free what you love
      Just to bring it back
      Would you ever lose me?
      Would you ever let go for that?

      And if the love is real, you gotta teach you
      Just to bring it back,
      Sometimes, just to bring it back
      The love you're bringing back

  - Outro: |

      The love you're bringing back

      Sometimes

      Sometimes
      .....
      Just to bring it back
      You got to go for awhile
