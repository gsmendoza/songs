[Intro]
<Em>---            ....
<Em>---            ....
<Em>---            ....
<Em>---            ....

[Verse]
<Em>---            My friend assures me,
<Em>---            "It's all or nothing"
<D>---             I am not worried,
<D>---             I am not overly concerned

<Em>---            My friend implores me,
<Em>---            "For one time only
<D>---             Make an exception"
<D>---             I am not worried

<Em>---            Wrap her up in a package of lies,
<Em>---            send her off to a coconut island
<D>---             I am not worried,
<D>---             I am not overly concerned

<Em>---            With the status of my emotions.
<Em>---            Oh, she says, "You're changing"
<D>---             But we're always changing.
<D>---             It does not bother me to say

[Pre-Chorus]
<Bm>---            This isn't love
<G>- <A>-          'Cause if you don't wanna to talk about it

<Bm>---            Then it isn't love
<G>- <A>-          And I guess, I'm gonna have to live without

<Bm>---            But I'm sure there's somethin' in a shade of gray
<G>- <A>-          Or somethin' in between

<Bm>---            And I can always change my name
<G>- <A>-          If that's what you mean

[Verse 2]
<Em>---            My friend assures me,
<Em>---            "It's all or nothing"
<D>---             But I am not really worried
<D>---             I am not overly concerned

<Em>---            You try to tell yourself the things,
<Em>---            you try tell yourself to make yourself forget,
<D>---             To make yourself forget
<D>---             I am not worried

[Pre-Chorus 2]
<Bm>---            "If it's love", she said
<G>- <A>-          Then we've gonna have to think about the consequences

<Bm>---            'Cause she can't stop shakin'
<G>- <A>-          And I can't stop touchin' her

[Chorus]
<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    And this time when kindness falls like rain,
<A>-               it washes her away

<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    And Anna begins
<A>-               to change her mind

<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    "These seconds when I'm shakin'
<A>-               Leave me shudderin' for days"

<D>- <G>-          She says
<Bm>- <A>-         And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

[Verse]
<Em>---            But I'm not gonna break
<Em>---            And I'm not gonna
<D>---             worry about it
<D>---             anymore

<Em>---            I'm not gonna bend
<Em>---            and I'm not gonna break
<D>---             Gonna worry about it
<D>---             anymore, No, no, no, no, no

<Em>---            It seems like I should say
<Em>---            "As long as this is love"
<D>---             But it's not all that easy
<D>---             so maybe I should

<Em>---            Snap her up in a butterfly net
<Em>---            And pin her down on a photograph album
<D>---             I am not worried
<D>---             'Cause you've done this sort of thing before

[Pre-Chorus 3]
<Bm>---            ....
<G>- <A>-          But then I start to think about the consequences

<Bm>---            'Cause I don't get no sleep
<G>- <A>-          in a quiet room

[Chorus]
<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    And this time when kindness falls like rain,
<A>-               it washes me away

<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    And Anna begins
<A>-               to change my mind

<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    Every time she sneezes
<A>-               I believe it's love

<D>- <G>-          And oh, Lord,
<Bm>- <A>-         I'm not ready for this sort of thing

[Chorus]
<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    She's talkin' in her sleep
<A>-               It's keepin' me awake

<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    And Anna begins
<A>-               to toss and turn

<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    And every word is nonsense
<A>-               But I understand

<D>- <G>-          And oh, Lord,
<Bm>- <A>-         I'm not ready for this sort of thing

[Outro]
<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    Her kindness bangs a gong
<A>-               It's movin' me along

<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    And Anna begins
<A>-               to fade away

<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    It's chasin' me away
<A>-               She disappears

<D>- <G>- <Bm>-    And oh, Lord,
<Bm>-              I'm not ready for this sort of thing

<D>...             ....
