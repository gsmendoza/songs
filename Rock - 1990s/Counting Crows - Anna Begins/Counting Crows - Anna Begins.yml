  - Verse: |
      My friend assures me,
      "It's all or nothing"
      I am not worried,
      I am not overly concerned

      My friend implores me,
      "For one time only
      Make an exception"
      I am not worried

      Wrap her up in a package of lies,
      send her off to a coconut island
      I am not worried,
      I am not overly concerned

      With the status of my emotions.
      Oh, she says, "You're changing"
      But we're always changing.
      It does not bother me to say

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      This isn't love
      'Cause if you don't wanna to talk about it

      Then it isn't love
      And I guess, I'm gonna have to live without

      But I'm sure there's somethin' in a shade of gray
      Or somethin' in between

      And I can always change my name
      If that's what you mean

  - Verse 2: |
      My friend assures me,
      "It's all or nothing"
      But I am not really worried
      I am not overly concerned

      You try to tell yourself the things,
      you try tell yourself to make yourself forget,
      To make yourself forget
      I am not worried

  - Pre-Chorus 2: |
      "If it's love", she said
      Then we've gonna have to think about the consequences

      'Cause she can't stop shakin'
      And I can't stop touchin' her

  - Chorus: |
      And this time when kindness falls like rain,
      it washes her away

      And Anna begins
      to change her mind

      "These seconds when I'm shakin'
      Leave me shudderin' for days"

      She says
      And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

  - Verse: |
      But I'm not gonna break
      And I'm not gonna
      worry about it
      anymore

      I'm not gonna bend
      and I'm not gonna break
      Gonna worry about it
      anymore, No, no, no, no, no

      It seems like I should say
      "As long as this is love"
      But it's not all that easy
      so maybe I should

      Snap her up in a butterfly net
      And pin her down on a photograph album
      I am not worried
      'Cause you've done this sort of thing before

  - Pre-Chorus 3: |
      ....
      But then I start to think about the consequences

      'Cause I don't get no sleep
      in a quiet room


  - Chorus: |
      And this time when kindness falls like rain,
      it washes me away

      And Anna begins
      to change my mind

      Every time she sneezes
      I believe it's love

      And oh, Lord,
      I'm not ready for this sort of thing

  - Chorus: |
      She's talkin' in her sleep
      It's keepin' me awake

      And Anna begins
      to toss and turn

      And every word is nonsense
      But I understand

      And oh, Lord,
      I'm not ready for this sort of thing

  - Outro: |
      Her kindness bangs a gong
      It's movin' me along

      And Anna begins
      to fade away

      It's chasin' me away
      She disappears

      And oh, Lord,
      I'm not ready for this sort of thing

      ....
