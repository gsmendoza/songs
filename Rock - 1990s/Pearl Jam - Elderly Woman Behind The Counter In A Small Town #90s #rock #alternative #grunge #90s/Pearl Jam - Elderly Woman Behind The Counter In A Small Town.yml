    (Fade...)

lyrics: 
  - Verse: |
      I seem to recognize
        your face

      Haunting, familiar, yet
        I can't seem to place it

      Cannot find the candle of thought
        to light your name

      Lifetimes are catching up
        with me

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      All these
        changes taking place
      I wish I'd seen the place
      But no one's ever taken me

  - Chorus 1: |
      Hearts and thoughts they fade,
        fade away

      Hearts and thoughts they fade,
        fade away

  - Verse: |
      I swear I recognize
        your breath

      Memories like fingerprints
        are slowly raising

      Me you wouldn't recall
        for I'm not my former

      It's hard when you're stuck upon
        the shelf

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      I changed
        by not changing at all
      Small town predicts my fate
      Perhaps that's what no one wants to see

  - Chorus 2: |
      I just wanna scream
        "Hello!"

      My God it's been so long
        Never dreamed you'd return

      But now here you are,
        and here I am

      Hearts and thoughts they fade
        away

  - Outro: |
      (1) Hearts and thoughts they fade
        fade away

      (2) Hearts and thoughts they fade
        fade away

      (3) Hearts and thoughts they fade
        a...way

      (4) Hearts and thoughts they fade
        fade away

      (5) Hearts and thoughts they fade
        fade away

      (6) Hearts and thoughts they fade
        fade away

      (7) Hearts and thoughts they fade
