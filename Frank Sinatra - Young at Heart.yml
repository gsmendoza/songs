lyrics:
  - Verse 1: |
      Fairy tales can come true
      It can happen to you
      If you're young at heart
      ...

  - Verse 2: |
      For it's hard you will find
      To be narrow of mind
      If you're young at heart
      ...

  - Verse 3a: |
      You can go to extremes
      With impossible schemes
      You can laugh when your dreams
      Fall apart at the seams

  - Verse 4a: |
      And life gets more exciting
      with each passing day
      And love is either in your heart
      Or on it's way

  - Verse 1: |
      Don't you know that it's worth
      Every treasure on earth
      To be young at heart
      ...

  - Verse 2: |
      For as rich as you are
      It's much better by far
      To be young at heart
      ...

  - Verse 3b: |
      And if you should survive to 105
      Look at all you'll derive
      Out of being alive
      ...

  - Verse 4b: |
      And here is the best part
      You've had a head start
      If you are among the very
      Young at heart
