lyrics:
  - Verse 1: |
      Blue moon you saw me standing alone
      Without a dream in my heart
      Without a love of my own
      ...

  - Verse 2: |
      Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
      You heard me saying a prayer for
      Someone I really could care for
      ...

  - Bridge: |
      And then there suddenly appeared before me
      The only one my arms will hold
      I heard somebody whisper "Please adore me"
      And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!

  - Verse 2: |
      Blue moon! Now I'm no longer alone
      Without a dream in my heart
      Without a love of my own
      ...
