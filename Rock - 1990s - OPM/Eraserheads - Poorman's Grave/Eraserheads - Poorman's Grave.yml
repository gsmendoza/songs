lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .... .. ..
      .... .. ..
      .... .. ..
      .... .. ..

  - Verse 1: |
      I know a man who had nothing
      He was a poor man all his life
      He lived in a shack by the roadside
      With starving kids and a loving wife

  - Interlude: |
      .... .. ..
      .... .. ..

  - Verse 2: |
      He went to church every Sunday
      He prays from morning until night, he said
      Good Lord, why have you forsaken me
      When everything I did I thought was right

  - Refrain: |
      Now my Life is coming to an end
      There's only one thing I'm wishing for
      All my days I have never sinned
      So I hope you won't ignore
      What I'm asking for...

  - Chorus 1: |
      Oh honey when I die
      Dress me up in a coat and tie
      Give my feet a pair of shoes
      That I haven't wore in a long time
      Put me in a golden box
      Not a cross on a pile of rocks
      Bury me where the grass is green
      And the gates are shining...

  - Chorus 2: |
      Oh honey when I die
      Give me a bed of roses where I could lie
      I'm gonna use up all the money that I saved
      Coz I dont wanna lie in a poor man's grave...

  - Interlude

  - Verse 1: |
      I know a man who had nothing
      He dreamed of satin sheets all his life
      He lived and worked like a dog
      Licking every boot he sees just to survive

  - Verse 2: |
      He comes home drunk every night
      Wakes up the kids and talks to his wife, he said
      Honey you have been so good to me
      I only wish we had a better life

  - Refrain: |
      Now my Life is coming to an end
      There's only one thing I'm wishing for
      All my days I have lived in shame
      So I hope you won't ignore
      Just what I'm asking for...

  - Chorus 1

  - Chorus 3: |
      Oh honey when I die
      Give me a bed of roses where I could lie
      I'm gonna use up all the money that I saved
      Coz I dont wanna lie in a poor man's grave...

  - Outro: |
      Oh honey when I die
      Give me a bed of roses where I could lie
      I'm gonna use up all the money that I saved
      Coz I dont wanna lie in a poor man's grave...
      ....
