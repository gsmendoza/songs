      .. ..

  - Verse: |
      And so she woke up from a dream
      That was beautiful and starry and oh so wild
      It was all still clear in her
        eyes

  - Verse: |
      And though her mind was foggy
        and blank, she wondered why
      Her life couldn't be as lovely it was
        time

  - Verse: |
      There was this king he had a castle
        or throne
      But his horse was great and
        white

  - Verse: |
      He rode alone and liked it
        that way
      But when he met her he swore
      He would never leave her side

  - Chorus: |
      .. ..
      They road across the land
      Two lovers hand in hand
      And no danger would come near

      And when something made her cry
      She'd look at him teary eyed
      And he would make her
        feel better

  - Interlude: |
      Oh
      so much better
      so much better than
        before

  - Verse: |
      And now this forest was his home
      It was a night time and the right time
      For love in
        the dark

  - Verse: |
      She placed her hand upon his chest
      And all the rest just flowed
      Makin' love down under
      An ancient far away night

  - Chorus: |
      .. ..
      It was so grand
      Just holding someone's hand
      And now safety came naturally oh yeah

      .. ..
      It was so clear
      that she would never
      ever have to fear

  - Verse: |
      Oh tell me a story
      of magic
      and spiralling ships and stars in the
        night

  - Verse: |
      Just whisper in my ears
      make it soft but make it clear
      I want to hear every breath you
        say

  - Verse: |
      And now this forest was their home
      It was a night time and the right yeah time
      For love in
        the dark

  - Verse: |
      She placed his hand upon her breast
      All the rest just flowed
      Makin' love down under
      An ancient far away night

  - Last Chorus: |
      .. ..
      But she woke up from the land
      Tears falling in her hands
      As she looked up askin' why

      .. ..
      She laid back in her bed
      Thoughts raising in her head
      "Why can't my life be beautiful," she said

      .. ..
      Yeah she closed her eyes again
      Just prayin' he'd return
      But only darkness fell upon her
