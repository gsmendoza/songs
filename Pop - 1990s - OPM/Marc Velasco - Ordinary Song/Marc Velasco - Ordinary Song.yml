      Just an ordinary song
      To a special girl like you
      From a simple guy who's so in love with you
      .. ..


  - Verse to Chorus: |
      I may not have much to show
      No diamonds that glow
      No limousines to take you where you go
      .. ..

  - Chorus: |
      But if you ever find yourself
      Tired of all the games you play
      When the world seems so unfair
      You can count on me to stay
      Just take some time to lend an ear
      To this ordinary song
      ..

      I don't even have the looks
      To make you glance my way
      The clothes I wear may just seem so absurd
      .. ..

  - Chorus: |
      But deep inside of me is you
      You give life to what I do
      All those years may see you through
      Still I'll be waiting here for you
      If you have time, please, lend an ear
      To this ordinary song
      ..
