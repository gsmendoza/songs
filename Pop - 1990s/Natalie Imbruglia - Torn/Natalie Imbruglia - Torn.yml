lyrics: 
  - Intro: |
      ....
      ....
      ....
      ....

  - Verse: |
      ... I thought I
      saw a man brought to life
      ... He was
      warm, he came around like he was
      dignified
      He showed me what it was to cry

  - Verse: |
      ... Well you couldn't
      be that man that I adored
      ... You don't seem to
      know, or seem to care what your
      heart is for
      I don't know him anymore

  - Pre-chorus: |
      There's nothin' where he used to lie
      Our conversation has run dry
      That's what's goin' on
      Nothing's fine, I'm torn

  - Chorus A: |
      I'm all out of faith,
      this is how I feel
      I'm cold and I am shamed
      Lying naked on the floor

      Illusion never changed
      Into something real
      I'm wide awake and
      I can see the perfect sky is torn

      You're a little late
      I'm already torn
      ....
      ....

  - Verse: |
      ... So I
      guess the fortune teller's right
      ... Should have
      seen just what was there and not some
      holy light
      But you crawled beneath my veins and now

  - Pre-chorus: |
      I don't care, I have no luck
      I don't miss it all that much
      There's just so many things
      That I can't touch, I'm torn

  - Chorus B: |
      I'm all out of faith,
      this is how I feel
      I'm cold and I am shamed
      Lying naked on the floor

      Illusion never changed
      Into something real
      I'm wide awake and
      I can see the perfect sky is torn

      You're a little late
      I'm already torn
      ....
      ....

      Torn
      ....

  - Instrumental: |

  - Pre-chorus: |
      There's nothing where he used to lie
      My inspiration has run dry
      That's what's goin' on
      Nothing's right, I'm torn

  - Chorus C: |
      I'm all out of faith
      This is how I feel
      I'm cold and I am shamed
      Lying naked on the floor

      Illusion never changed
      Into something real
      I'm wide awake and
      I can see the perfect sky is torn

  - Chorus D: |
      I'm all out of faith
      This is how I feel
      I'm cold and I am ashamed
      Bound and broken on the floor

      You're a little late
      I'm already torn
      ....
      ....

      Torn
      ....
      Oh

  - Outro: |
      ....
      ....
      ....
      Oh yeah, oh yeah

      ....
      ....
      ....
      Oh yeah, oh yeah
