      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..

  - Verse A: |
      Have I told you lately that I love you
      Have I told you there's no one else above you
      You fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness
      Ease my troubles, that's what you do
 
  - Verse B: |
      For the morning sun and all its glory
      Greets the day with hope and comfort, too
      You fill my heart with laughter, and somehow, you make it better
      Ease my troubles, that's what you do

  - Chorus: |
      There's a love that's divine, and it's yours and it's mine
      Like the sun
      And at the end of the day, we should give thanks and pray
      To the one, to the one

      Take away all my sadness, fill my life with gladness
