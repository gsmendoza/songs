  - Verse: |
      And I don't know
        how I knew it
      But I knew it
        somehow

      You're the answer
        to the question
      No one's answered
        till now

  - Chorus: |
      And I don't know what you see
      What you see in me
      Girl it's nothing to
      what I see
      in you

  - Break: |

  - Verse: |
      Stars that glisten
        Lips for kissin'
      Honey listen
        it's true

      No one ever
        loved you better
      I love ya honey

  - Chorus: |
      And I've known a girl or two
      But none of them was you
      And they could never be
      what you are
