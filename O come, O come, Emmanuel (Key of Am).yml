lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      O come, O come, Em-man-u-el
      And ransom captive Is---rael
      That mourns in lonely ex--ile here
      Un-til the Son of God a-ppear

  - Chorus: |
      Re-joice! Re-joice! Em-man-u-el
      Shall come to thee, O Is--ra-el.

  - Verse: |
      O come, Thou Rod of Je-sse, free
      Thine own from Satan's ty--ranny
      From depths of Hell Thy peo-ple save
      And give them victory o'er the grave

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer
      Our spirits by Thine ad-vent here
      Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
      And death's dark shadows put to flight.

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      O come, Thou Key of David, come,
      And open wide our heavenly home;
      Make safe the way that leads on high,
      And close the path to mi--sery.

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      O come, O come, Thou Lord of might,
      Who to Thy tribes, on Sinai's height,
      In ancient times did'st gi-ve the Law,
      In cloud, and majesty and awe.

  - Chorus
