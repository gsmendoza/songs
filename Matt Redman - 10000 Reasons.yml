  - Chorus: |
      Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul,
      Worship His holy name.
      Sing like never before, O my soul.
      I'll worship Your holy name.

  - Verse: |
      The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning;
      It's time to sing Your song again.
      Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,
      Let me be singing when the even- ing comes.

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger.
      Your name is great, and Your heart is kind.
      For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing;
      Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      And on that day when my strength is failing,
      The end draws near, and my time has come;
      Still my soul will sing Your praise unending:
      Ten thousand years and then fore - - vermore!

  - Chorus
