lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      ...

  - Verse 1: |
      There were bells on a hill
      but I never heard them ringing.
      No I never heard them at all
      ‘til there was you.

  - Verse 2: |
      There were birds in the sky
      but I never saw them winging.
      No I never saw them at all,
      ‘til there was you.

  - Bridge: |
      And there was music, and there were wonderful roses,
      they tell me,
      in sweet fragrant meadows
      of dawn and dew.

  - Verse 1: |
      There was love all around,
      but I never heard it singing.
      No I never heard it at all,
      ‘til there was you.
