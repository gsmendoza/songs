lyrics:
  - Verse 1: |
      The falling leaves drift by my window
      The autumn leaves of red and gold
      I see your lips the summer kisses
      The sunburned hands I used to hold

  - Verse 2: |
      Since you went away the days grow long
      And soon I'll hear old winter's song
      But I miss you most of all my darling
      When autumn leaves start to fall
