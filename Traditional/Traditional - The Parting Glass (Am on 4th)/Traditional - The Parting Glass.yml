lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      Oh all the money that e'er had
      I spent it in good company
      And of all the harm that e'er I've done
      Alas, it was to none but me

      For all I've done
      For want of wit
      To memory now I can't recall

      So fill to me the parting glass
      Good night and joy be with you all

  - Verse: |
      Of all the comrades that e'er I've had
      They're sorry for my going away
      And of all the sweethearts that e'er I've had
      They'd wish me one more day to stay

      But as it falls
      unto my lot
      That I must go and you must not

      I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
      Good night and joy be with you all
