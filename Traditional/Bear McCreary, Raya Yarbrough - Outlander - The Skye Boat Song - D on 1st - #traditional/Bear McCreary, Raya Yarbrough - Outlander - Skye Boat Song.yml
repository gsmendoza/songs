lyrics:
  - Chorus: |
      Sing me a song of a lass that is gone
      Say, could that lass be I?
      Merry of soul, she sailed on a day
      Over the sea to Skye

  - Verse: |
      Billow and breeze, islands and seas
      Mountains of rain and sun
      All that was good, all that was fair
      All that was me is gone

  - Last Chorus: |
      Sing me a song of a lass that is gone
      Say, could that lass be I?
      Merry of soul, she sailed on a day
      Over the sea to Skye
