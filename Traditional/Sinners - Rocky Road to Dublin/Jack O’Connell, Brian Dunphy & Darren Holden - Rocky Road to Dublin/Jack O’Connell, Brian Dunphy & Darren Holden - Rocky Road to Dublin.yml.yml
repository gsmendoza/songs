lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      Then off to reap the corn,
      and leave where I was born
      I cut a stout black thorn,
      for to banish ghosts and goblins

      A brand new pair of brogues,
      to rattle over the bogs
      And frightened all the dogs
      on the rocky road to Dublin

      One, two, three,
      four, five

  - Verse: |
      Well, in the merry month of May,
      from me home I started
      Left the girls of Tuam
      were nearly broken-hearted

      Saluted Father dear,
      kissed me darling mother
      Drank a pint of beer,
      my grief and tears to smother

      Then off to reap the corn,
      leave where I was born
      Cut a stout black thorn
      to banish ghosts and goblins

      Brand new pair of brogues,
      rattlin' over the bogs
      And frightened all the dogs
      on the rocky road to Dublin

      One, two, three,
      four, five

  - Chorus: |
      Hunt the hare and turn her down
      the rocky road and all
      the way to Dublin, whack
      follol le-dah

  - Verse: |
      In Mullingar that night,
      I rested limbs so weary
      Started by daylight
      next morning, bright and airy

      Took a drop of the pure
      to keep me heart from sinkin'
      That's the Paddy's cure
      whenever he's on for drinkin'

      To hear the lassies smile,
      laughin' all the while
      At me curious style,
      'twould set your heart a bubblin'

      Asked me was I hired,
      wages I required
      'Til I was almost tired
      of the rocky road to Dublin

      One, two, three,
      four, five

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      In Dublin next arrived,
      I thought it such a pity
      To be so soon deprived
      a view of that fine city

      Then I took a stroll,
      all among the quality
      Bundle it was stole,
      in a neat locality

      Something crossed me mind,
      when I looked behind
      No bundle could I find
      upon me stick a-wobblin'

      Enquiring for the rogue,
      said me Connaught brogue
      Wasn't much in vogue
      on the rocky road to Dublin

      One, two, three,
      four, five

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      From there I got away,
      my spirits never failin'
      Landed on the quay,
      just as the ship was sailin'

      Captain at me roared,
      said that no room had he
      When I jumped aboard,
      a cabin found for Paddy

      Down among the pigs,
      played some funny rigs
      Danced some hearty jigs,
      the water 'round me bubblin'

      Off to Holyhead,
      wished meself was dead
      Or better far instead,
      on the rocky road to Dublin

      One, two, three,
      four, five

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      The boys of Liverpool,
      when we safely landed
      Called meself a fool,
      I could no longer stand it

      Blood began to boil,
      temper I was losin'
      Poor old Erin's Isle,
      they began abusin'

      "Hurrah me soul," says I,
      shillelagh I let fly
      Galway boys were by
      and saw I was a hobblin'

      With a loud "Hurray!"
      joinin' in the affray
      We quickly cleared the way
      on the rocky road to Dublin

      One, two, three,
      four, five
