[Intro]
...         Then off to reap the corn,
...         and leave where I was born
...         I cut a stout black thorn,
...         for to banish ghosts and goblins

...         A brand new pair of brogues,
...         to rattle over the bogs
...         And frightened all the dogs
...         on the rocky road to Dublin

...         One, two, three,
..          four, five

[Verse]
<Am>--      Well, in the merry month of May,
<Am>--      from me home I started
<Am>--      Left the girls of Tuam
<Am>--      were nearly broken-hearted

<Am>--      Saluted Father dear,
<Am>--      kissed me darling mother
<Am>--      Drank a pint of beer,
<Am>--      my grief and tears to smother

<Am>--      Then off to reap the corn,
<Am>--      leave where I was born
<Am>--      Cut a stout black thorn
<Am>--      to banish ghosts and goblins

<Am>--      Brand new pair of brogues,
<Am>--      rattlin' over the bogs
<Am>--      And frightened all the dogs
<Am>--      on the rocky road to Dublin

<Am>--      One, two, three,
<Am>-!      four, five

[Chorus]
<Am>--      Hunt the hare and turn her down
<Am>--      the rocky road and all
<Am>--      the way to Dublin, whack
<Am>--      follol le-dah

[Verse]
<Am>--      In Mullingar that night,
<Am>--      I rested limbs so weary
<Am>--      Started by daylight
<Am>--      next morning, bright and airy

<Am>--      Took a drop of the pure
<Am>--      to keep me heart from sinkin'
<Am>--      That's the Paddy's cure
<Am>--      whenever he's on for drinkin'

<Am>--      To hear the lassies smile,
<Am>--      laughin' all the while
<Am>--      At me curious style,
<Am>--      'twould set your heart a bubblin'

<Am>--      Asked me was I hired,
<Am>--      wages I required
<Am>--      'Til I was almost tired
<Am>--      of the rocky road to Dublin

<Am>--      One, two, three,
<Am>-!      four, five

[Chorus]
<Am>--      Hunt the hare and turn her down
<Am>--      the rocky road and all
<Am>--      the way to Dublin, whack
<Am>--      follol le-dah

[Verse]
<Am>--      In Dublin next arrived,
<Am>--      I thought it such a pity
<Am>--      To be so soon deprived
<Am>--      a view of that fine city

<Am>--      Then I took a stroll,
<Am>--      all among the quality
<Am>--      Bundle it was stole,
<Am>--      in a neat locality

<Am>--      Something crossed me mind,
<Am>--      when I looked behind
<Am>--      No bundle could I find
<Am>--      upon me stick a-wobblin'

<Am>--      Enquiring for the rogue,
<Am>--      said me Connaught brogue
<Am>--      Wasn't much in vogue
<Am>--      on the rocky road to Dublin

<Am>--      One, two, three,
<Am>-!      four, five

[Chorus]
<Am>--      Hunt the hare and turn her down
<Am>--      the rocky road and all
<Am>--      the way to Dublin, whack
<Am>--      follol le-dah

[Verse]
<Am>--      From there I got away,
<Am>--      my spirits never failin'
<Am>--      Landed on the quay,
<Am>--      just as the ship was sailin'

<Am>--      Captain at me roared,
<Am>--      said that no room had he
<Am>--      When I jumped aboard,
<Am>--      a cabin found for Paddy

<Am>--      Down among the pigs,
<Am>--      played some funny rigs
<Am>--      Danced some hearty jigs,
<Am>--      the water 'round me bubblin'

<Am>--      Off to Holyhead,
<Am>--      wished meself was dead
<Am>--      Or better far instead,
<Am>--      on the rocky road to Dublin

<Am>--      One, two, three,
<Am>-!      four, five

[Chorus]
<Am>--      Hunt the hare and turn her down
<Am>--      the rocky road and all
<Am>--      the way to Dublin, whack
<Am>--      follol le-dah

[Verse]
<Am>--      The boys of Liverpool,
<Am>--      when we safely landed
<Am>--      Called meself a fool,
<Am>--      I could no longer stand it

<Am>--      Blood began to boil,
<Am>--      temper I was losin'
<Am>--      Poor old Erin's Isle,
<Am>--      they began abusin'

<Am>--      "Hurrah me soul," says I,
<Am>--      shillelagh I let fly
<Am>--      Galway boys were by
<Am>--      and saw I was a hobblin'

<Am>--      With a loud "Hurray!"
<Am>--      joinin' in the affray
<Am>--      We quickly cleared the way
<Am>--      on the rocky road to Dublin

<Am>--      One, two, three,
<Am>-!      four, five

[Chorus]
<Am>--      Hunt the hare and turn her down
<Am>--      the rocky road and all
<Am>--      the way to Dublin, whack
<Am>--      follol le-dah

[Chorus]
<Am>--      Hunt the hare and turn her down
<Am>--      the rocky road and all
<Am>--      the way to Dublin, whack
<Am>--      follol le-dah

[Chorus]
<Am>--      Hunt the hare and turn her down
<Am>--      the rocky road and all
<Am>--      the way to Dublin, whack
<Am>--      follol le-dah
