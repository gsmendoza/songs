[Intro]
.. .. ..             Then off to reap the corn, and leave where I was born
.. .. ..             I cut a stout black thorn, for to banish ghosts and goblins
.. .. ..             A brand new pair of brogues, to rattle over the bogs
.. .. ..             And frightened all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

.. .. .              One, two, three, four, five

[Verse]
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Well, in the merry month of May, from me home I started
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Left the girls of Tuam were nearly broken-hearted
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Saluted Father dear, kissed me darling mother
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Drank a pint of beer, my grief and tears to smother

<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Brand new pair of brogues, rattlin' over the bogs
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    And frightened all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

<Am>- <Am>- <Am>!    One, two, three, four, five

[Chorus]
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    And all the way to Dublin, whack follol le-dah

[Verse]
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    In Mullingar that night, I rested limbs so weary
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Started by daylight next morning, bright and airy
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Took a drop of the pure to keep me heart from sinkin'
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    That's the Paddy's cure whenever he's on for drinkin'

<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    To hear the lassies smile, laughin' all the while
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Asked me was I hired, wages I required
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    'Til I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin

<Am>- <Am>- <Am>!    One, two, three, four, five

[Chorus]
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    And all the way to Dublin, whack follol le-dah

[Verse]
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Then I took a stroll, all among the quality
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Bundle it was stole, in a neat locality

<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    No bundle could I find upon me stick a-wobblin'
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Enquiring for the rogue, said me Connaught brogue
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin

<Am>- <Am>- <Am>!    One, two, three, four, five

[Chorus]
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    And all the way to Dublin, whack follol le-dah

[Verse]
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    From there I got away, my spirits never failin'
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailin'
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Captain at me roared, said that no room had he
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy

<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Down among the pigs, played some funny rigs
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Danced some hearty jigs, the water 'round me bubblin'
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Off to Holyhead, wished meself was dead
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Or better far instead, on the rocky road to Dublin

<Am>- <Am>- <Am>!    One, two, three, four, five

[Chorus]
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    And all the way to Dublin, whack follol le-dah

[Verse]
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Blood began to boil, temper I was losin'
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Poor old Erin's Isle, they began abusin'

<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    "Hurrah me soul," says I, shillelagh I let fly
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Galway boys were by and saw I was a hobblin'
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    With a loud "Hurray!" joinin' in the affray
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    We quickly cleared the way on the rocky road to Dublin

<Am>- <Am>- <Am>!    One, two, three, four, five

[Chorus]
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    And all the way to Dublin, whack follol le-dah

[Chorus]
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    And all the way to Dublin, whack follol le-dah

<Am>- <Am>- <Am>-    And all the way to Dublin, whack follol le-dah
