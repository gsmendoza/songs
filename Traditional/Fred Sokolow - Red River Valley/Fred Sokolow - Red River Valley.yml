lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      From this valley they say you are going.
      We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile.
      For they say you are taking the sunshine
      that has brightened our lives for a while.

  - Verse: |
      Come and sit by my side if you love me.
      Do not hasten to bid me adieu.
      But remember the Red River Valley
      and the cowboy who loved you so true.

  - Verse: |
      Won’t you think of the valley you’re leaving.
      Oh how lonely and sad it will be.
      And think of the fond heart you’re breaking
      and the grief you are causing to me.

  - Verse: |
      As you go to your home by the ocean,
      may you never forget those sweet hours
      That we spent in the Red River Valley
      and the love we exchanged mid the flowers.
