  This is based on Happy Traum's version of the song, which you can find at
  "Basic Arranging Techniques that Every Guitarist Should Know - Video 1". I
  simplified the chords in this tab so that it's easier to see the chord
  progression.

  - Verse: |
      The water is wide, I can not cross over
      And neither have I wings to fly
      Build me a boat that will carry two
      And both shall row, my love and I

  - Verse: |
      A ship there is and she sails the sea
      And she’s loaded deep, as deep can be
      But not so deep as this love I’m in
      I know not how I sink or swim

  - Verse: |
      Oh love is gentle and love is kind
      And love’s a jewel when first it’s new
      But when it’s older, it waxes colder
      And it fades away like summer dew

  - Verse: |
      I lean my back against an oak
      Thinking it was a trusty tree
      But first it bended, then it broke
      As did my own false love to me

  - Verse: |
      The water is wide, I can not cross over
      And neither have I wings to fly
      Build me a boat that will carry two
      And both shall row, my love and I
