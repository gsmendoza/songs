lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      All my life, without a doubt I give you
      All my life, now and forever till the
      Day I die, you and I will share
      ....

  - Verse: |
      All the things this changing world can offer
      So I sing, I'd be happy just to
      Stay this way, spend each day, with you
      ....

  - Chorus: |
      There was a time, that I just thought
      That I would lose my mind
      You came along and then the sun did shine
      We started on our way

      I do recall that every moment spent
      Was wasted time
      but then I chose to lay it on the line

      I put the past away
      I put the past away
      I put the past away

  - Solo: |
      .... ....
      .... ....
      .... ....
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      All my life, I will carry you through
      All my life, between each hour of the
      passing days, I will stay with you
      ....

  - Chorus/Outro: |
      There was a time, that I just thought
      That I would lose my mind
      You came along and then the sun did shine
      We started on our way

      I do recall that every moment spent
      Was wasted time
      but then I chose to lay it on the line

      I want this all my life
      I want this all my life
      I want this all my life
      I want this all my life
      I want this all my life
      I wanted this all my life

      ....
