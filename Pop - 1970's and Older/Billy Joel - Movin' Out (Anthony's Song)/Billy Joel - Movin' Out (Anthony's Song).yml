  - Verse: |
      Anthony works
      in the grocery store
      Savin' his pennies
      for someday

      Mama Leone left
      a note on the door, she said,
      "Sonny, move out
      to the country"

      Ah, but workin' too hard can give you
      a heart attack (ack-ack-ack-ack-ack)
      You oughta know
      by now

      Who needs a house out
      in Hackensack
      Is that all you get
      for your money?

  - Chorus: |
      And it seems such a waste
      of time
      If that's what it's
      all about

      Mama, if that's movin' up
      Then I'm...
      movin' out

  - Break: |
      ..
      I'm moving out
      ..
      Mmm,

      Hmm
      Ooh-ooh,
      uh-huh,
      ..

  - Verse: |
      Sergeant O'Leary is
      walkin' the beat
      At night he becomes
      a bartender

      He works at Mr. Cacciatore's
      Down on Sullivan Street
      Across from the
      medical center

      And he's tradin' in his Chevy
      for a Cadillac (ac-ac-ac-ac-ac)
      You oughta know
      by now

      And if he can't drive
      with a broken back
      At least he can
      polish the fenders

  - Chorus: |
      And it seems such a waste
      of time
      If that's what it's
      all about

      Mama, if that's movin' up
      Then I'm..
      movin' out

  - Break: |
      ..
      I'm movin' out
      oh, oh
      ..

      Ooh-ooh,
      oh-oh,
      uh-huh,
      ..

  - Verse 3: |
      You should never argue with
      a crazy mind (mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-)
      You oughta know
      by now

      You can pay Uncle Sam
      with the overtime
      Is that all you get
      for your money

  - Chorus: |
      And if that's what you have
      in mind
      Yeah, if that's what you're
      all about

      Good luck movin' up
      'Cause I'm...
      moving out

  - Break: |
      Mmm,
      I'm movin' out,
      mmm-hmm
      ..

      Ooh-ooh,
      uh-huh,
      mmm
