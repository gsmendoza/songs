  - Verse A: |
      Wise men say
      Only fools rush in
      But I can't help
      falling in love with you

  - Verse A: |
      Shall I stay?
      Would it be a sin
      If I can't help
      falling in love with you?

  - Verse B: |
      Like a river flows
      Surely to the sea
      Darling, so it goes
      Some things are meant to be

  - Verse A: |
      Take my hand
      Take my whole life, too
      For I can't help
      falling in love with you

  - Verse B: |
      Like a river flows
      Surely to the sea
      Darling, so it goes
      Some things are meant to be

  - Verse A: |
      Take my hand
      Take my whole life, too
      For I can't help
      falling in love with you

  - Outro: |
      For I can't help
      falling in love with you
