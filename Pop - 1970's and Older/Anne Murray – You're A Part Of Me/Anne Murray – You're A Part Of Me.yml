  - Verse A: |
      I'd like to live out
        all my dreams

      And if I could,
        yes, if I could

      The nicest one would be with you
      And you'd be here with me,

      Don't you ever get lonely?
      ....

  - Verse B: |
      Lord, I'm no good when you're away,
        but what do you expect

      from a girl
        who loves you like I love you?

      Won't you ever just get tired?
      And come on home to me,

      Don't you ever get lonely?
      ....

  - Chorus: |
      You're a part of me
      That I can't do without

      You're a part of me
      That dreams are all about

      But you can't hold on to
      Something that you've never had

      before
      Love waits for the wind
      To bring you back again

  - Interlude: |
      And take you away
      ....

  - Verse C: |
      Friends say, it's great now, you're a star
        But what do they expect

      From a girl
        who loves you just the way you were?

      And late
        at night, I wish things had never changed
        And you were here with me

      Don't you ever get lonely?
      ....

  - Chorus

  - Outro: |
      And take you away (take you away)
      ....

      Take you away (take me away)
      ....

      Honey, I love you (take me away)
      ....

      Take me away (take me away)
      ....

      Cause honey, I love you (take me away)
      ....
