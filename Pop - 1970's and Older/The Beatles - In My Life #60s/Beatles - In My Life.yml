lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      ...
      ...

  - Verse: |
      There are places I'll remember
      All my life though some have changed
      Some forever not for better
      Some have gone and some remain

  - Chorus: |
      All these places have their moments
      With lovers and friends I still can recall
      Some are dead and some are living
      In my life I've loved them all

  - Lick: |
      ...

  - Verse: |
      But of all these friends and lovers
      There is no one compares with you
      And these memories lose their meaning
      When I think of love as something new

  - Chorus: |
      Though I know I'll never lose affection
      For people and things that went before
      I know I'll often stop and think about them
      In my life I love you more

  - Solo: |

  - Chorus

  - Outro: |
      ...
      In my life I love you more
      ...
