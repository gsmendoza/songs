lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .. ..
      .. ....

  - Verse A: |
      I'd like to live out
        all my dreams

      And if I could,
        yes, if I could

      The nicest one would be with you
      And you'd be here with me,

      Don't you ever get lonely?
      ....

  - Verse B: |
      Lord, I'm no good when you're away,
        but what do you expect

      from a girl
        who loves you like I love you?

      ..
      Won't you ever just get tired?
      And come on home to me,

      Don't you ever get lonely?
      ....

  - Chorus: |
      You're a part of me
      That I can't do without

      You're a part of me
      That dreams are all about

      But you can't hold on to
      Something that you've never had

      before
      Love waits for the wind
      To bring you back again

  - Verse B: |
      Friends say, it's great now, you're a star
        But what do they expect

      From a girl
        who loves you just the way you were?

      Oh and
        late at night, I wish things had never changed
        And you were here with me

      Don't you ever get lonely?
      ....

  - Chorus

  - Outro: |
      And take me away
      ....
      Take me away
      ....

      Take me away
      ....
      Take me away
      ....

      Oh, take me away
      ....
      Take me away
      ....

      Oh, take me away
      ....
      Take me away
      ....

      Oh, take me away
      ....
      And take me away
      ....

      Oh, take me away...
      ....
