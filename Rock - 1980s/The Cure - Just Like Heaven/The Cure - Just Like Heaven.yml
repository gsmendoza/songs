  - Verse: |
      "Show me show me show me how you do that trick,
      The one that makes me scream" she said

      "The one that makes me laugh" she said
      And threw her arms around my neck

      "Show me how you do it
      And I promise you I promise that

      I'll run away with you
      I'll run away with you"

  - Verse: |
      Spinning on that dizzy edge
      I kissed her face and kissed her head

      And dreamed of all the different ways
      I had to make her glow

      "Why are you so far away?" she said
      "Why won't you ever know

      That I'm in love with you
      That I'm in love with you"
 
  - Chorus: |
      You, soft and only
      You, lost and lonely
      You, strange as angels
      Dancing in the deepest oceans
      Twisting in the water, you're just like a dream
 
  - Solo: |
      (1) you're just like a dream

  - Verse: |
      Daylight licked me into shape
      I must have been asleep for days

      And moving lips to breathe her name
      I opened up my eyes

      And found myself alone alone
      Alone above a raging sea

      That stole the only girl I loved
      And drowned her deep inside of me

  - Coda: |
      You, soft and only
      You, lost and lonely
      You, just like heaven
      ....
