  - Verse: |
      I've never seen you look
      like this without a reason
      Another promise fallen through
      Another season passes by you

  - Interlude: |
      .... ..

  - Verse: |
      I never took the smile
      away from anybody's face
      And that's a desperate way to look
      For someone who is still a child

  - Chorus: |
      In a big country dreams stay with you
      Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
      Stay alive

  - Post-Chorus: |
      .. ..

      I thought that pain and truth
      were things that really mattered
      But you can't stay here with
      every single hope you had shattered

      .. ..

  - Riff: |

  - Verse: |
      I'm not expecting to grow
      flowers in a desert
      But I can live and breathe
      And see the sun in wintertime

  - Chorus: |
      In a big country dreams stay with you
      Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
      Stay alive

  - Chorus: |
      In a big country dreams stay with you
      Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
      Stay alive

      So take that look out of here
      it doesn't fit you
      Because it's happened doesn't
      mean you've been discarded

      Pull up your head off the floor,
      come up screaming
      Cry out for everything
      you ever might have wanted

      I thought that pain and truth
      were things that really mattered
      But you can't stay here with
      every single hope you had shattered

      .. ..

      In a big country dreams stay with you
      Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
