lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      .... ....
      .... ....
      .... ....
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
      But I knew that it would come
      An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
      She said you found someone

  - Refrain: |
      And I thought of all the bad luck, and the struggles we went through
      And how I lost me and you lost you
      What are these voices outside love's open door
      Make us throw off our contentment and beg for something more?

  - Chorus: |
      I'm learning to live without you now
      But I miss you sometimes
      The more I know, the less I understand
      All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again

      I've been trying to get down to the Heart of the Matter
      But my will gets weak and my thoughts seem to scatter but I think it's about
      Forgiveness, forgiveness
      Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

  - Interlude: |
      .... ....
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      These times are so uncertain, there's a yearning undefined
      And people filled with rage
      We all need a little tenderness, how can love survive
      In such a graceless age

  - Refrain: |
      The trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
      They're the very things we kill, I guess
      Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
      And the work I put between us, you know it doesn't keep me warm

  - Chorus: |
      I'm learning to live without you now
      But I miss you, baby
      The more I know, the less I understand
      All the things I thought I figured out, I have to learn again

      I've been trying to get down to the heart of the matter
      But everything changes and my friends seem to scatter, but I think it's about
      Forgiveness, forgiveness
      Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

  - Interlude 2: |
      .... ....

  - Bridge: |
      There are people in your life who've come and gone
      They let you down, you know they hurt your pride
      You better put it all behind you, baby, 'cause life goes on
      You keep carrying that anger, it'll eat you up inside, baby

  - Chorus: |
      I've been trying to get down to the Heart of the Matter
      But my will gets weak and my thoughts seem to scatter, but I think it's about
      Forgiveness, forgiveness
      Even if, even if you don't love me

      I've been trying to get down to the Heart of the Matter
      Because the flesh will get weak and the ashes will scatter, so I'm thinking about
      Forgiveness, forgiveness
      Even if, even if you don't love me

  - Last Chorus: |
      Forgiveness, forgiveness
      Forgiveness, forgiveness
      Forgiveness, forgiveness
      Even if you don't love me anymore

  - Outro: |
      Forgiveness, forgiveness
      Forgiveness, forgiveness
      .... ....
