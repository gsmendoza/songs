lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      (Bass)
      (Bass)
      .... ....
      .... ....

      .... ....
      .... ....
      Once upon a time, not so long ago
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      Tommy used to work on the docks
      Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
      It's tough,
      So tough

  - Verse: |
      Gina works the diner all day
      Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
      For love
      Mm, for love

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
      It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
      We've got each other and that's a lot for love
      We'll give it a shot"

  - Chorus: |
      Woah, we're halfway there
      Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
      Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
      Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

  - Interlude: |
      .... ....

  - Verse: |
      Tommy's got his six-string in hock
      Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
      So tough
      Ooh, it's tough

  - Verse: |
      Gina dreams of runnin' away
      When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
      "Baby, it's okay
      Someday"

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      We've gotta hold on to what we've got
      It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
      We've got each other and that's a lot for love
      We'll give it a shot

  - Chorus 2: |
      Woah, we're halfway there
      Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
      Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
      Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer,
      livin' on a prayer

  - Guitar Solo: |

      Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
      You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

  - Chorus 3: |
      Woah, we're halfway there
