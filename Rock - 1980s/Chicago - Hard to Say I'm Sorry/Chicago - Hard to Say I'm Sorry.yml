  - Intro: |
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..

  - Verse: |
      Everybody needs a little time away
      I heard her say, from each other
      Even lovers need a holiday
      Far away, from each other
 
  - Pre-Chorus 1: |
      Hold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry
      I just want you to stay
 
  - Chorus: |
      After all that we've been through, I will make it
        up to you, I promise to
      And after all that's been said and done
      You're just a part of me, I can't let go

  - Verse: |
      Couldn't stand to be kept away
      Just for the day, from your body
      Wouldn't wanna be swept away
      Far away, from the one that I love

  - Pre-Chorus 2: |
      Hold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry
      I just want you to know

      Hold me now, I really wanna tell you I'm sorry
      I could never let you go

  - Chorus

  - Key Change: |
      After all that we've been through, I will make
        it up to you, I promise to

  - Solo: |

      .. .. .. You're gonna be
      the lucky one
