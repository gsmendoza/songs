lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      (Missing you, missing you)
      (Missing you, missing you)
      (Missing you, missing you)
      (Missing you, missing you)

  - Verse A: |
      Every time I think of you
      I always catch my breath
      And I'm still standing here and you're miles away
      And I'm wondering why you left

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      And there's a storm that's raging
      Through my frozen heart tonight

  - Verse A: |
      I hear your name in certain circles
      And it always makes me smile
      I spend my time thinking about you
      And it's almost driving me wild

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      And there's a heart that's breaking
      Down this long distance line tonight

  - Chorus: |
      I ain't missing you at all
      Since you've been gone away
      I ain't missing you
      No matter what I might say

  - Verse B: |
      There's a message in the wire
      And I'm sending you this signal tonight
      You don't know how desperate I've become
      And it looks like I'm losing this fight
      In your world I have no meaning
      Though I'm trying hard to understand

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      And it's my heart that's breaking
      Down this long distance line tonight

  - Chorus

  - Bridge: |
      And there's a message that I'm sending out
      Like a telegraph to your soul
      And if I can't bridge this distance
      Stop this heartbreak overload

  - Chorus

  - Fake Outro: |
      I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
      I keep lying to myself

  - Pre-Chorus: |
      And there's a storm that's raging
      Through my frozen heart tonight

  - Chorus

  - Outro: |
      Ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
      I ain't missing you, I keep lying to myself
      Ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
      I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you

  - Outro: |
      I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
      Ain't missing you, Oh no
      (Missing you, missing you, missing you)
      No matter what my friends might say, I ain't missing you
