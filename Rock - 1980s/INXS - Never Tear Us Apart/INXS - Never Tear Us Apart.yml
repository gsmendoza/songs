  - Verse: |
      Don't ask me
      What you know is true
      Don't have to tell you
      I love your precious heart

  - Chorus: |
      I
      I was standing
      You were there
      Two worlds collided
      And they could never tear us apart
      ....

  - Verse: |
      We could live
      For a thousand years
      But if I hurt you
      I'd make wine from your tears

  - Verse: |
      I told you
      That we could fly
      Cause we all have wings
      But some of us don't know why

  - Chorus: |
      I
      I was standing
      You were there
      Two worlds collided
      And they could never, ever, tear us apart
      ....
