lyrics: 
  - Intro: |
      Hey, hey, hey, hey
      Ooh, woah
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..

  - Verse: |
      Won't you come see about me?
      I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
      Tell me your troubles and doubts
      Giving everything inside and out and

      Love's strange, so real in the dark
      Think of the tender things that we were working on
      Slow change may pull us apart
      When the light gets into your heart, baby

  - Chorus 1: |
      Don't you, forget about me
      Don't, don't, don't, don't
      Don't you, forget about me
      .... ....

  - Bridge: |
      Will you stand above me?
      Look my way, never love me
      Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
      Down, down, down

      Will you recognize me?
      Call my name or walk on by
      Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
      Down, down, down, down

  - Interlude: |
      Hey, hey, hey, hey
      Ooh, woah
      .. .. .. ..
      .. .. .. ..

  - Verse: |
      Don't you try and pretend
      It's my feeling we'll win in the end
      I won't harm you or touch your defenses
      Vanity and security, ah

      Don't you forget about me
      I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
      Going to take you apart
      I'll put us back together at heart, baby

  - Chorus 2: |
      Don't you, forget about me
      Don't, don't, don't, don't
      Don't you, forget about me
      As you walk on by

      Will you call my name?
      As you walk on by
      Will you call my name?
      And you walk away

  - Down Chorus: |
      .... ....
      Or will you walk away?
      .... ....
      Will you walk on by?

      .... ....
      Come on, call my name
      Will you call my name?
      I say

  - Outro: |
      La, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
      La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
      La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
      La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

      La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
      La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
      When you walk on by
      ....
